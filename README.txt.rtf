There are four python notebooks.\
\
EDA on podcast metadata:\

In this notebook, I get transcripts from json files and did text cleaning and EDA on transcripts. I concatenate descriptions and transcripts into one dataframe.\
\
Extractive models:\
In this notebook, I built extractive models, Baselines, TFIDF , Count Vectorization , Text rank model.\
\
Abstractive model building:\
In this notebook, I built seq2seq models based on LSTM layers. \
