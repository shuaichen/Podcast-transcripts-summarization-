      "Hello. Hello. Hello everyone. This is Katie and we are here together on our first ever episode of cream in your coffee. Thank you so much guys for humoring me on this podcast Journey. It's been a huge goal of mine for the past few years. I finally just growing a pair and jumping right into it and seeing how it goes. So, thank you again for bearing with me here.  Alrighty guys, so I figured for the first episode why not jump into a topic that is so exciting for pretty much everybody out there just around the corner and seven or eight days. We have the wonderful Christmas and I'm so excited Christmas is a great time of year for me. I just love the spirit of happiness and joy and the giving spirit. I love every single part of it and I hope that you guys are excited for it to obviously it would definitely  I say that most people are I find most excited about receiving gifts around Christmas time. I'm definitely the opposite I get really really awkward when someone gives me a gift but I get so excited to give someone else a gift and just to see their faces when they open it. I'd like to think that I'm pretty good with gifts. I usually think of something like thoughtful or I'll even make something for someone so it really just depends on the person obviously, but I don't know doing something nice for someone always feels good, right?  Anyways, so I wanted to just give a couple tips for you guys because I did work retail for several years of my life and I'm honestly very very happy that I am not this year because I hate crowds and even though I work with people I kind of hate people. So seeing frantic men and women running all over the mall trying to figure out what to buy their loved ones for a holiday. That's like usually two days away is a little stressful for me, but this year I don't have to worry about  But thank goodness.  So my first tip for you guys is going to seem probably unhelpful right this minute, but in future Christmases to come it's going to save you big time. It's going to save you stress and it's going to save you money come December so  I'm going to say tip. Number one Santa knew what was up. Okay, make a list and check that shit twice. I don't mean make a list right before you go out shopping the day of gentlemen. I'm sure your shopping Christmas Eve. Stop fucking doing that. I mean throughout the year make a list of things that your friends and family make comments about so things that they always use things that they want things they enjoy  And this is going to save you a headache because not only is this list going to have a backup list of things that you can buy if you are totally stuck on gifts, but you also have something to reference all year long.  When you can pick things up, so this is where it's going to save you financially. You're not coming around to December of next year and you're like shit. I don't have enough money to buy Christmas gifts or you know, you see those memes that are like it looks like people going to be getting a Merry Christmas message for Christmas. That's what my bank account looks like. No, you're going to go it's going to be July and your best friend Janine really likes, you know, Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume. So you pick it up in July and then you have it in your closet for Janine come to  Brr. Okay, it's going to save you a gift that you have to remember to buy and it's going to save you money in December when you're already forking out the dough tip number one make a list kind of wraps into this number two or tip number two, because tip number two is by throughout the year things are going to go on sale people always get so excited for like Black Friday shopping and Boxing Day sales. I will say Boxing Day tends to have a little bit better.  Sales, I personally find four things then Black Friday, but I've had this conversation with people before where they're like, oh my God, like Black Friday deals are so good. But people are lined up around the block. I guarantee you that Best Buy has pretty much that same deal on a television Midway through the year. You just don't notice because you're not looking it up. So just be conscientious of what you're looking to buy and when the deals are honestly check throughout the year and you're going to save yourself at least like four.  Out a chunk of dough in December at least you're saving yourself that financial burden if not finding the deals as well and saving money that way so tip number one is make a list and tip number two is by throughout the year.  The last tip that I'll leave you guys with for the Christmas season is the three gift rule. So this is something that I initially started doing for children and realize that it was also a really good starting point for gifts for your adult friends as well. So I the gifts are very simple one thing you want one thing you need and one thing to read. So one thing they want something they've brought up something that they've mentioned to you that they would love to have.  But they just can't afford right now or whatever one thing they need. So ladies, you know, if your man's taking his pants off and his boxers look like moths have gotten into his underwear drawer. He needs some briefs and or Underoos or boxers or whatever the hell you call them. Go get you a man's some underwear. So again, the first two is one thing you want and one thing you need one thing you read. I love this one.  Honestly, this is great. I love it because I used to read all the time and now it takes me five months to read a book that I would probably finish in two days. So one thing to read gets everyone on that educational truck and gives their brain a little bit of a workout.  Now the one thing to read is also kind of a fun little gift because it gives the other person that you are giving to an insight into your brain and what you would kind of read or at least what you would suggest for them. So it opens up some Avenues of may be an author that they never thought to look into or some storylines that they might like that they didn't know they would so it's like a gift that keeps on giving you know, it's wonderful.  So those are my three Christmas tips for you guys tip 1 make a list and check it twice tip to shop throughout the year rather than leaving it as one huge task and lump sum of money that you need to Shell out come December and tip 3 is try the three gift rule.  So hopefully you guys found those tips at least minimally helpful. I found that anyone that I have told those things to obviously prior to December 17th have actually found that quite helpful to kind of do it throughout the year. Like I said, it just takes a lot of Burden off of you and the third tip at least helps you to have a platform to start with on how and where to start getting gifts.  So guys, like I said, I'm a huge fan of Christmas as much as I love the spirit of it though. Like if you know me in person, you've seen me dressed up for work for Christmas full on Santa socks the whole getup that being said with all this excitement that I have for the Christmas season. I don't actually decorate my place. Um, I think I have one stocking that A friend gave me several years ago. And that's the one Christmas decoration that I have and that goes  On my door, so I'm not a huge decorator surprisingly enough. I will be having a guest on next week though for next episode and her family goes all out. So we will definitely be talking with her about her Christmas traditions and how they decorate.  Now you guys are probably thinking like what the fuck is this person talking about she loves Christmas, but she doesn't decorate what is up with that. I don't know. I'm just not a huge decorating person. It might also be because I have two small dogs and they just get into everything. I also live alone. So I think it just for me at least seems a little silly to set up a whole bunch of Christmas decorations just to take them down for myself to look at them. I don't know if that's just a lot of effort with  A lot of return I guess. I don't know. I don't like Snow either. So the weather recently hasn't exactly been my favorite, but given that it is Christmas. I will take a nice fluffy layer of snow for Christmas day that's acceptable, I guess so mother nature. Feel free to send us a little bit of snow, but no ice no hail and no freezing rain. Thank you.  So I'm not a huge fan of snow and I don't decorate my place and I'm not a huge fan of receiving gifts. I mean you guys are probably thinking why does this woman keeps saying that she loves Christmas. So here is why I love Christmas. As I said before. I love the joy that everyone has I love the good mood that it puts most people in although I hate snow. I do like when it looks like a winter wonderland - the slush and the slipping  So the joy I guess but absolutely my number one favorite thing about this season is seasonal coffees. So eggnog latte is Starbucks. You know, what the fuck is up? That is my favorite. Honestly, eggnog anything throw me some rum in that nog and we got a good time going on and also just the little the cops to  Like just the festive little cups that they give you I love every part of it. Yeah, if you didn't catch that, I love eggnog. So in case anyone wants to gift me eggnog I can do something fun with that. Maybe I don't I don't fucking know if anyone has any ideas of eggnog cocktails as well. I recently discovered an eggnog colada so fucking good. Maybe we'll talk about that on the next episode but  Yeah, I mean definitely go check just Starbucks and check out the eggnog latte is because if you seen my stories I pretty much have at least one a day for the entire month of December and then I wonder why I gained weight and it's actually because I've been drinking all the cream and egg. Nog me now as for Christmas traditions, I don't really do much. Typically I hang out with my family on Christmas Day.  As most people do my family as you know, as you get older people typically end up moving all over the place. So this year we won't be having a big family Christmas. I am lucky enough to have a fantastic boyfriend who is hosting Christmas Eve dinner this year. So I'll be able to spend some time with him and hopefully I will be able to visit my brother and his fiance who are actually expecting so I'm very excited to see them.  And say hello to their little nugget that is not born yet. But I think I got the right to rub her belly and say hello to the outer womb given. I'm the baby's Aunt I don't know Roxy if you're listening to this, please let me know if I'm not allowed to do that. So I don't make an awkward situation down the road. Anyways guys. Thank you so much for listening. Like I said huge huge.  Huge shout out to every single one of you that has listened because I am extremely nervous, but I'm really happy that I put myself out there and gave it a try. So thank you so so much guys, and we will see you next episode where I will be interviewing one of my good friends Katarina who like I said, her family is a huge Christmas family, and we'll be learning a little bit more about what they do for Christmas on the next episode. Thanks for tuning in guys. Bye. \n",
      "Welcome to inside the 18. Today's episode is the sit down from the United Soccer Coaches convention with former US Men's National Team and former u.s. Women's National Team goalkeeper coach Phil weddin filled discusses how he started the international goalkeeper coaches conference what the US needs to do in order to create a successful goalkeeping curriculum across the entire United States and he gives his best advice to Young goalkeepers and goalkeeper coaches for me. This is by far one of my favorite episodes from the convention and I'm super excited for you guys to hear it. Make sure to follow inside the ATM on both.  Apple podcast and on Spotify and last but not least. Don't forget to leave us a rating and a comment to let us know how we're doing. Once again. Here's Phil wedding.  Welcome to inside the 18 live at United Soccer Coaches convention. Why does a Sokka like I'm Bostonian sometimes all of a sudden my dad is from Boston, but that sounded really interesting the way I did that Sokka convention United Soccer Coaches convention the afternoon sessions after the nwsl draft. We've been having a fantastic time here. I'm Michael Majid with me. Obviously Omar zini with his microphone is far away.  Away from him as possible. Oh and we're using the exact same microphone. That's good. We have a special guest with us today because that's what we do at a live Coaches convention is find better coaches than ourselves to get on the podcast. So with us today is Phil wedding. He's the head of the international goalkeeper coaches conference. I always I can never get that right igcc. Obviously fantastic resume as a goalkeeper coach, obviously us.  Women's National Team programs. It's worked with MLS as worked at all. The highest levels Phil. Thanks for being on inside the 18. Thanks very much for having me. I'm looking forward to having a brief chat here. Hopefully I can come up with a few jokes as well. Just to keep things going. You know, honestly. I was just telling I was telling everybody that I'm like, you know, this is just gonna be like us last night. Basically for those of you guys unfamiliar, which is everybody here has no idea what I'm talking about after feels incredible session last night. We all went to Katie O'Shea's bar and we all hung out the goalkeepers.  Onion style round robin style until people could no longer drink and and then that's when we that's when we left and it was a fantastic time and I said, you know what this is just basically what you're going to do tomorrow only with a microphone. He's like, yeah, I'm in for that. That sounds yeah. Yeah, you're drinking Waters a and I'm a you know, honestly last night when you were in a Boston hat so don't know you're right. Yeah, right so that totally works. I think that totally works so far. I've been having fun so far obviously you've been to a lot of conventions which how many conventions you been to now I think 10 or 12 cents.  Over these over the course of time. I've missed a couple here and there but you know, it's always great to come to these events because you see people that you haven't seen in so many years you reconnect with people. It's a place where a lot of coaches find opportunity as well. It's also a great way to share information and knowledge you cut you come in with the one that one set of ideals and beliefs and oftentimes, you'll leave with a better set or revamp set of ideas. So it's a great situation to come to this and the way I know that you've had experience doing this as  That after last night session you had lost your voice and by today completely back completely back which means you've you're a veteran of this. Yeah, unfortunately, sometimes when you when you're not on the field with a microphone for for a while, you lose your voice. So yeah happened to me last night and some people would say that be actually a blessing but you know, yeah the session I thought went really well and it was great to have so many of the goalkeeper Union there to support me. But one thing I definitely really appreciate it after the session yesterday.  You asked all the coaches to kind of give you some recommendations on what they saw and you know, it's just you as someone at your level and you've done it for so long. It's like crazy to believe that you'd still ask other coaches for advice and like you said earlier you come to the convention with some certain set of ideals and then you leave would like not refined but like, you know, even more advanced because the coaching is the coaches around here you pick their brain and stuff like that. So I thought that was really cool to see even about you know as a young coach now, I see somebody at your statute your level and you doing that it rubs off really well on me. So thank you for that. No, I'm pretty  He said that but the thing for me is we're always learning. The game is always evolving. So we have to evolve as coaches and you're in the conversations that you have with other goalkeeper coaches. There isn't one right way or one wrong way to do it. It's you know, you may see something from the session last night say, oh I'll move the goals this way or I would serve it here or I would use a rebounder or you'd come up with different ideas. And that's why I asked for feedback because if someone has something that they feel is valuable. I want to know because I want to get better and that's what that's what coaching is about is about  Sharing ideas and adapting what you see to fit the level of the athletes you working with Phil. I'm glad that you brought up rebounder because we have a giant rebounder in the back here. We need to give it to somebody that Pro deflect over there. We've got these catalogs here and they're like, yeah, you know, once you try to sell that thing, I'm like, I don't even think somebody could get this out of the building. He's like, you should set it up set it up somewhere in the front. I'm like, no one would literally be able to see us we would be behind the pro deflect like this and then people be like trying to Strike balls at us. It would not go well.  No, everything resonated with me with what you said last night because nothing tells me that somebody is a high-level coach then when they get off the field saying what can I do to improve this session as opposed to what did you think of my session huh? And that that's that's professionalism in my opinion, you know again look at like I said, the goalkeeping side of things is so in depth and everyone has a own way of doing things and like I said, I don't think there's a right or wrong way.  The end of the day of the Bulls night in the back of the net with the goalkeepers have done their job if we've had some small parts of playing that that then great but I want to get better. You know that I don't think there's a limit to what you can learn and how you can change things. If you look at all the information that's coming out of Europe right now on the blocking and the spreading and all those things. You know, I think we've all got to learn we've all got to keep adapting and that's what I look forward to doing. Yeah, you know speaking of education and getting better you obviously run the igcc before  Or that you didn't involved in various, you know educational programs. I believe you had been an instructor for the u.s. National goalkeeping license for u.s. Soccer. Can you tell us how igcc began and that is a total tongue twister? For those of you guys who have not heard the edit it took me about three times to say that it's difficult, but it's impressive. So tell us a little bit about yeah. So, you know, I was fortunate enough to be involved with us soccer both on the men's side of the women's side for a long time. I was also  Lucky enough to work with the gentleman by the name of Peter Miller who is a goalkeeping legend in the US and actually in England, he played in England. I would say that he was my mentor and he invited me in 2006 which dates me a little bit to become part of the coaching education platform with us goalkeeping. So there was a u.s. Goalkeeper National goalkeeper license that ran from 2006 to 2015.  In January 15, I think was the last one and then nothing happened. So I started to think well, how can I develop where can I go to see other coaches work and learn from other people. So I actually went to a conference myself in Holland. It was called the Bilderberg International goalkeeper coaches conference is run by a gentleman by the name of Martin arts. And I had a conversation with Martin and I thought well how cool would it be to actually do this in the u.s. Because there wasn't an opportunity to learn?  From other other coaches, so I approached my sponsors. I approached quick goal who have been a fantastic in their support me and I approach your sport who also support me and we put together the igcc 2016 was the first time and you know, it's been growing ever since so it's really an opportunity for coaches around the country and internationally and we have people come from Dubai come from the Maldives coming from wherever  it's an opportunity for coaches to learn from other professional coaches. So it's really a once it's the only opportunity like that in America at the moment and it allows people to go to Florida. Yeah, you know Flo Florida is also and you know, there are many drawbacks of Florida. So yeah, you can pop down there come to the igcc and then pop off see Minnie and Mickey and Donald and Pluto, you know, I am glad that you said the reason they did not discontinue the u.s. Goalkeeping licenses because after  I took it. It wasn't like US soccer. Like Tim mulqueen came back to the moment. Listen, we can't keep letting people like that into this thing. We have to make it more of a pro license. No, I like what you guys do because the educational purpose of it and also the international flavor to it, you know, it's not just the same people over and over again with the same voice you're getting different voices from all over the world. So is that what makes igc unique in the Americas? Yeah, I think so, you know the thing that's  Again, just going back to my philosophy a little bit. I don't think there's a right and a wrong way and that's why having these people from different parts of the world to present and share the information and share their experience and their knowledge is critical because you can take something from say a mikkel reckon who works at hoffenheim. You can take something from him in Germany. You could take something from Andrew Sparks who is in works for the Orlando pirates in South Africa, and then you can take something from John actor Berg from Liverpool or from wherever so and then you put it  Inform your own style. So that's what's so valuable about it. You know the first time I met Andrew Sparks, he was 21 years old and I hated him because I was like, how is this guy so good. So young he was like a product in his hair is always perfect. Always perfect. He's good-looking dude. It was just everything about him was just like why and he was a smaller keeper and he was better than me as just I don't like know. I love Andrew Sparks. I actually follow him religiously online and I wish Sparks he was here, you know at convention. I know he wishes he was here as  Well, yeah, absolutely. No, so now I think Omar has a few things that he wants to talk to you about because I've been hogging the microphone completely. He's actually like know you could keep going. You know, let's talk about some of the variables in regards to developing a curriculum because we talked about this a little bit last night during our goalkeeper Seance. I'd like to call it and we were talking about you were saying you would love to see you a soccer put together an actual curriculum that people actually follow and so so talk a little bit about your methodology and why  I think this is so important for us as a country. Well again, I think that has to be a profile that has to be something that we as goalkeeper coaches, whether we agree with it or disagree with it. We as goalkeeper coaches look at it and say okay. This is a model that on National program is looking for so what is the profile of full International goalkeeper was a profile over u-20 goalkeeper. How do we develop that profile? So goalkeeper coach is like ourselves could then say okay. I need to work on.  On this this and this to help Sarah or help Jeff gets at a level. They need to be at so developing that type of curriculum that philosophy that profile I think is essential just as a starting point and it takes a tremendous amount of Bravery to do that because obviously after the session last night, I got battered partly because my left foot but, you know, you get battered after every session do because in in the world of goalkeeping everyone can always do your job better. So it takes  It would take a tremendous amount of courage to do it. But I think it's necessary to do it so that we can all develop see now. You haven't seen my weak foot trust me. You did not get battered. If you saw my weekly that's almost told me all about. So let's talk about this though. Like we want to incorporate one curriculum into this country. This is a vast country unlike, you know, Western Europe or some of the you know, smaller countries where they have like, let's take the Netherlands. For example, very easy to put our curriculum together when you got a small country nowadays is  Vast and obviously people come from all different walks of life and they're very opinionated in their point of view on how something should be done. So is it impractical for us to believe that this can be done here is non-prime school, but I don't think it's a job for one person and I think that's essential. It can't be one person's philosophy. It has to be a collaboration and there are so many great goalkeeper in mines in this country that that should be utilized and and are underutilized.  So if we could collaborate with ex-players, you know X national team players some of the goalkeeping Legends are out there, you know, the damn Gas bars and people like that that have the experience of working internationally and come up with a profile and then it needs to be implemented but not just by one person by a by a collective group of people. I mean quite honestly and and you know, I've I'm a huge fan of your soccer. The the national team program has been exceptionally good to me and I'm  I'm a massive massive supporter, but we don't have anyone in charge of goalkeeping Education when I was in England recently. They have fired they had five full-time goalkeeper coaches just just on the men's side, but they also had that they also had responsibilities within coaching education. So here we are competing with a country. That's the size of say Pennsylvania or something like that and they have five people just on the men's side.  And they also have similar numbers on the women's side of the game. So now you're talking about between 5 and 10, maybe even 15 and they have goalkeeping Scouts. By the way, they have all these numbers of people all identifying goalkeepers all working on goalkeeper curriculum all following the same message so that their goalkeeper coaches throughout the country can then impart the same message and and and philosophy so it can be done but it's not a job for one person and I really feel like we as goalkeeper coaches need direction is in the  Country, I think a lot of what you're saying right there just showcases the difference in attitude. And then you know, I'm joking and saying that like, you know, the goalkeeper of the Year award FIFA goalkeeper of the Year award is coming home, you know both on the men and women side, but it really sounds like they're really investing their time into it. So, you know, you see the Jordan pickford's you see the Angus guns coming out of the national team program in you know, England and that's not just by coincidence. No, it's all you know, and I've been fortunate.  Have to be involved in a recent camp in England. They are they are pushing this development at every age group and every coach is on board and is fantastic, you know is it's a method that again would be great for us to install in this country at whatever level it could be. Maybe it needs to be at individual MLS clubs and nwsl clubs and filter that down. Maybe it needs to be the National Team level, but it certainly can be done and and you're seeing the results of their educational system with  The success that the English youth national teams have had so let's talk about that a little bit and Omar at some point. You're going to interject because otherwise I will not let you talk. You did not get your wow on camera, by the way because you turned your head you went wow like that. Nobody could see that other than on the YouTube thing here, but if you're listening to the podcast, but let's let's I'm going to give you a second, but I want to get to this right now because it's very important. We were talking about the physical attributes last night. Yes, we were and we were there with a goalkeeper very accomplished John.  Yeah, who was a different physical attributes than let's say Brad? Who's on right? Okay. Yeah, obviously both came through the US soccer system. Both very accomplished well-respected goalkeepers, Jordan Pickford Angus gun two completely different types of physical attributes to what is the fa doing to incorporate their curriculum, but yet still take into consideration different physical attributes of a goalkeeper. Well, they have a goal keep in DNA. So they've identified  I'd and tributes they would each goalkeeper is profiled this with this is what we're looking for. If they are say for example, if they are under sized if there is such a thing as being undersized for a national team goalkeeper, they have to have a certain exceptional quality. So if you look at John and Pete Pickford, you might say yeah. Well, he's a little shorter than I can David the hair or something like that. But what's his exceptional quality he distribution is out of this world, so  What are looking at both on the men's side and women side? So while they have this DNA and they have ideas of what they're looking for. There's also this special quality that they're goalkeepers have to have you have a specific idea for a goalkeeper. Indeterminate DNA. Like what's your when you see somebody how do you size them up or what? Is it that you enjoy seeing the most out of them? Well as modern times and all that. Yeah. Well, mommy your hair is perfect. You know, you've got this designer stubble going, you know, you've got a lot going for you. I think maybe maybe you might fit this.  Profile. It's the product of the LA Galaxy Academy. That's that's what happens there. It's all it's all about looks there. No. No, I think you know, obviously you have to the physical nature of the position is such that but on the men's side of the women's side, you have to fit a certain characteristic so hides hides his important obviously strength is important the technical aspects and you can break it down into the four pillars or five pillars that technical tactical physical psychological.  And then you've got a social aspect as well as as Michael here checks his phone. I didn't text you. No. No, that's a socialite. No, I was just what I want to make sure we're not giving taking away too much time from okay. That's why I was what it was. Yeah. Absolutely. It was had nothing to do with the fact that Tyler stelter from stir Ellie was texting me. What about the Emojis? Okay. I talked to Daryl and Taylor Total Soccer show because they haven't they have an opinion about me with the Emojis. Okay. Alright when we went on tour.  This summer smiley face after everything party favors. I have a I have a condition. I have a question for you how important I have a lot of kids who are listening and watching this. I'm going to show it to him. How important is it for young goalkeepers to be active in the game, you know after the game a lot of kids will, you know, take off their gloves to whatever they don't even watch soccer anymore. They're done it only they show up to practice and that's it. How important is them for to watch the EPL that he gets to see how these other goalkeepers like the day has not as always guys how the different styles how to implement  Then incorporate their Styles into their game, I feel like as a kid I used to wake up before we had TV. I used to wake up early. Watch Arsenal games every single week see Layman see my God. There's a guy with the Nike language. I used to watch those guys in the morning and I used to say, wow. I love how he's gonna get his defense. I love always sets up the wall and I take it to my game. So how important is that in terms of goalkeeping education. Do you feel for the younger people people? I feel like the young goalkeeper needs to watch the game. We've got to be students of the game. You can't just play a game on Saturday Sunday and then forget about it until practice ideally.  They could watch their own performance and get that type of feedback. That would be ideal. But watching we've got to be careful with the watching other goalkeepers. And I think we do need to watch soccer. We do need to watch more and more games. But what you'll see then is you'll see these professional goalkeepers that are making both on the men's side of women's side making emergency type saves. So the blocking is spreading and all that and now that's sexy and fashionable. So they'll be doing those types of sales that we making those types of saves in  Situations and then well, hold on a second. Ashlyn Harris did that or listener did that or David the head that and then we've got to be careful. So I think it's critical that they watch and learn if they could if goalkeeper coaches out there can provide them provide their goalkeepers with video of themselves. Perfect. That's fantastic but watching and learning from others and learning when and how to do these techniques I think would be fantastic at the igcc do you guys offer?  That as like a not a prerequisite but you talked to the goalkeeper coach as you say this is something we recommend you do with your goalkeepers. Let's show you a little bit of film and then let's break it down for them is that you guys do that at all the Fantastic thing about the people that come into the presenters are come to the conference. For example that Michael reckoner will be there this year from hoffenheim and he will bring video of his goalkeepers in hoffenheim and he'll talk through this these situations and watch this is why we did this and this is how we do this. So absolutely we break down.  Video will force enough to have Eric steal who's a goalkeeping legend. He's been he was there for two years and the stories and the video and the explanation of the the who the why the when and the how of all these goalkeepers that are well known. Yeah that that's that's invaluable. And that's something that we absolutely do preach at the igcc. Yeah. One thing that I want to bring up is we're talking about developing a curriculum and implementing it, you know,  one one thing and we talked about it with Joe Lloyd and obviously this morning and we again we talked about the block safe because it seems to be that one topic that really leads to this conversation because a lot of people are teaching it and they don't know how to present it to the players in a way that they understand when in a game this is useful and we talked about the fact that everything we need to train our goalkeeper coach is to understand how to convey Vermeer information to somebody that's game relatable. Absolutely. It's not game relatable than  Just training so you can train all you want the blocking but if they don't know how to use it in a game so typesetting you can't and one thing that I love about what I've seen about the igcc is every activity whether it's the beginning warm up all the way through the progression is all game-related and it just it just builds and builds and builds and builds and builds and I think that's the type of curriculum we need in this country because I see too many trainers not enough coach young and making it game related.  All is critical. The thing that I would add to that is we're going to add angles to that. So I see a lot of this blocking stuff. I see a lot of you know, social media is blown up on it. As you know, if you can go on Instagram or whatever and you can see fifty thousand different people doing it. The thing that I would encourage is and you talked about making it relatable to the game. How often does it's this blocking in spreading come straight on and yet that's what you see on on Instagram and everything else is all these people coming straight on well that very rarely happens. It's  See when it touches at an angle and you're trying to almost cover some ground or an emergency safe. So making it relatable in our training from angles and having players running and having Defenders and having rebounds and all those types of things are critical we talked about it last night. It's essentially the the 2018 or 2019 version of the Cobra of coming out spreading yourself and you know back then the Cobra was obviously he's going down and smothering the ball. Now you're staying higher but it's essentially the same angle run that you're making to cover that.  Ace and you do I see how many 12 13 year-olds ball comes in a 1v1. They don't stay in a compact shape and stay high and wait until the player makes a move they spread themselves and then the ball gets slotted underneath them are lifted right over them, you know, so it's all about timing. It's all about the right approach. It's all about the Technical Training as well. And again as we talked about last night's the physical dimensions that are goalkeeper, you know, I'm tall and slow so, you know, maybe I would need to stand higher and maybe make a blocking save or use my feet. You're not quite as  Vertically gifted as I am. So maybe maybe you would be blocking. Maybe you'd be quicker or sorry. Maybe you would be quicker going down and making a cobra. You know that smothering Cobra say well using more of a technical sales per se I'm gonna ask you a question a little bit away from all this. No. No, it's just in terms of development. So my younger kids when I was first getting into coaching I would do a lot more of just kind of try and do more game related stuff and I realized that I wasn't getting the quality that I wanted just because the younger kids  I don't want to bash them with goals and get their confidence low. So what I've started to do and I wanted to record I wanted to ask you if it's we recommend this other coaches. I started doing more of like I do an hour session more like 40 minutes more of the technical side keeps them. They don't basic techniques and then the last 20 minutes we go full on like no no take off the training wheels we go on and do more actual game like scenarios. So now we can kind of implement those technical aspects into the Tactical side. Do you feel like that's a good way to develop a younger goalkeeper or do you feel like just throw?  Throw them into more game Mike Sanders let them learn. So again, if you follow a simple my simple pattern for a session would be simple to complex. So for young for young goalkeepers, I think sometimes you have to take away the consequence of conceding a goal because that element of failure if it happens over and over and over again, you're destroying a child's confidence and that's massively important as you know for goalkeepers because we're all fragile now, so  For a training session simple to complex and I would add I mean you could you could start out of gold. So there was no consequence and then build into goal and then just make that end product as you said made the end product far more functional and game-related and for goalkeeper coaches as well or sorry for younger goalkeepers as well when they get into, you know certain levels that require more of them their goalkeeper coach is obviously have to prepare them for that stuff. So I just feel like, you know a lot of coaches they don't it.  Of with their goalkeepers, they try and keep it very very simplified and then as they get older it kind of hurts the goalkeeper in the long run because they don't slowly progress them into that next level and I'm sure now go ahead I don't know I'm saying like, you know as a coach yourself you just playing in so many years. It's like you said, it's just constantly evolving as a coach is the new parts of the game. You're always trying to learn and bring the best your goalkeepers, which is why the conference I feel like it's super beneficial for coaches to go learn as much as they can then bring it back to their goal Keepers and everyone benefits.  Yeah, I think you know and as Michael you touched on goalkeeper trainers versus goalkeeper coaches, you know, and that's that's the thing. We can pick people off the street and going smash balls, you know, if we could pick any coach here at this convention and say hey, it goes smashing balls at our goal Keepers and they might say you've got to move your feet quicker or go to get your hands to the ball or whatever it may be. But but well, I'll even take it further. I mean, I don't want to interject here. But the thing is I you can they can literally watch your session last night.  Hand that to them and say do this without them understanding and as long as you give them a step-by-step of what to do, they could run that session do they know why they're running that session and can they convey that information to those kids? So they understand why they're doing it. That's what makes a coach in my opinion. Yeah, absolutely. So it's the Y and as the the five W's who what when where and why so why are you doing it who's involved? When does it happen? You know, all those things become critically important.  And as a goalkeeper coach as your sign on my you've got a relay that information, you know or layer in even with the goalkeepers that you work with from a young age so they can understand what when you do this why you do it, you know, and and we're on the field. So it's taking the goalkeepers to the next level is massively important. It doesn't end with 10 volleys into the hands and you're done. Okay. Now now go play you've done as a goalkeeper coach. You better get behind the goal and coaching within the goal as well one.  That I think is really concerning and I want all the coaches out here to here and listen to people like Phil if you don't listen to myself or Omar, but how many kids I've gotten who literally only learned basic footwork and handling because that's all their coach ever worked on with them. Yeah, and and again a young ages that that's massively important. You've got to have a technical Foundation, but then we got to progress them. We have to progress on because the technical foundation without a technical Foundation. You're not even going to get into a good position. So within that 10  Uncle Foundation is the efficiency of movement is angle play is basic angles and we must make sure that all our young goalkeepers know the angles know their basic techniques so that we can advance them but having said that we've also got advancement of soccer players because obviously now the Modern Trend of the game is a goalkeeper with the ball at their feet XI field player and has something my mentor Peter Melo has been talking about for years and years is the integration of the goalkeeper into  Team and how important it is that we as goalkeeper coaches are able to coach the team and work with the back for and integrate the goalkeeper because now distribution and playing and a defensive schemes and everything else becomes so Paramount in the success of the goalkeepers the success of the team, that's the great videos that I've seen on about igcc that I love the most is in its handling to distribution. It's not just handling distribution separate its handling to distribution or distribution to handling.  When there's a breakdown in mistake, and now there's a shot on goal or you play or shot on goal. Then you play the ball out but everything is all related to you know, having the ball and not having the ball, which is my favorite part of yeah, and I would encourage coaches out there. It's have a feeling of when you do an exercise. Where does that exercise start? What where does it start from? So where's the exercise start from and why right and what's the end product? So when the ball is hit the goalkeeper if their end product is I Chuck it in the back of the net and I take it.  One we might have a bit of a problem. So actually having the distribution of transitional aspect to it. We asked our field place to do that all the time when the ball transition forward. Well, the goal keeper isn't is another extension of that. So when the ball possess the ball transition forward and that's why the distribution aspect is important. Yeah real quick fill before we move on. Oh, no mom's got something to say. I just saw his face. That was my favorite part. I was like real quick fill before you move on. He's like no no get it. Hey, you're the one editing this haircut.  No, no, no quick what I liked about your session a lot yesterday was the progressions and a lot of you started with one part of the drill. Then you I the way I think about it like activation one activation to activation three, then you go. Then you go drill one drill. That's how I am. I one of my series that I'm filming right now for my YouTube channel. That's what I've been doing. More of I talked to one of the keepers and he gave me some feedback and he was like dude you're throwing us into these into these drills Without Really warming us up. Of course. I got a little upset about I'm like no. No, I know what I'm doing. Then I was like, you know what? No. No, I got to have more activation activation than progressions progression bar. So when I saw your session yesterday reaffirm that  In my head, so I really gave me the understanding of like you got to progressively get these guys ready to hit those, you know, harder shots and get those, you know, the mechanics and proper mechanics that you're going to implement and introduced in the beginning and then they're going to reappear later on in the session which was really good. Yeah. So, you know, if you notice his last night two goals, I actually had three cones that marks the six-yard box for both goals. So minimal equipment. There was a mannequin in their side with the Foot Skills little bit of handing little bit of dive in Libya shot stopping.  And then that you've covered all the bases and you're ready to go. So are you doing Technical Training? Yes, is it an angle? Yes, is it functional? Yes, so, you know, so yeah, the activation part was all within the same setup and then you make it functional as quickly as possible when you have so younger kids who were listening and who want to become successful goalkeepers. What is your best two or three pieces of advice to give them to start working on it. Now number one is never stop learning you're going to have different goalkeeper. Coach has not one is right. Not one is wrong. Take a piece from every session take a piece from every  Coach put it together form your own style. Number two, I'd say we focus on Basics focus on the fundamentals of the game your bread and butter the things that you every goalkeeper needs. And then the other thing that I would say is take care of yourself. Take care of your body, make sure you're physically and mentally capable of playing and Performing because you never know who's watching. Let's just say you're all the knowledge you have now and you're starting over from square one as your first day of coaching any advice for young goalkeeper coach is out there anybody that is  just hopping into the game right now. Yeah, the thing the thing that we will do as goalkeeper coaches and I was partly kidding but it's serious goalkeeper coach is a brutal because everyone can always do your job better and oh he he misses or she didn't pick up on that. So everyone can do job better. I would say, you know, if I was trying out again, I would want to be more open-minded right from the start and pick everyone's brain someone that someone always has some valuable information that you can you can take and learn from so  I feel like when I was younger, I was very close. Well, not very close mind. I was a little bit more closed minded. So really taking every opportunity to learn. I love you everything you just said right there and it really goes back. I love you too, Michael it goes back to the maturity standpoint. I think obviously the longer you do something the more mature you become and the more humbled you become because you see what you're doing is really about them and not about you and I think as a  As a young coach I will talk about myself and I realized when I was a younger coach if I reflect back a lot of times sessions when I was young was trying to prove to the Deo see how great a goalkeeper coach. I was rather than about making that you nine making that you 10 the best goalkeeper. They can be for that time and for their ability level and sometimes it just takes growing up a little bit and I think to recognize that so if coaches really hear that to heart keep learning stay humble and one day you could  The igcc look I said it right first time at first time before we move on. What are the plans for the igcc in 2019? I know you guys are going on this year and its getting bigger and better than ever. Obviously we're talking about the hoffenheim performance. Yeah. So this year we've moved we moved location where the IMG Academy which is fantastic, you know, we're really excited to be there. Obviously. They have a brand new hotel the Legacy  Tell that's where we're going to be based the right now, we've announced for presenters. So we are running a stone from iac's so he works in a tri-axial Academy which is which is critical. We've got our people from different levels. So Renee is is a well-known coach and we're really excited to have him Sparks. He will be back. He's sort of been a Mainstay and the reason why sparks is back this year is because he's transitioned into a new role. He went from the Youth Academy at Swansea in  The first team at one of the top clubs in Africa that was that in itself is a documentary because that was an experience that I didn't I didn't see for see that coming in anyway whatsoever and I'm sure he's got stories about about that. And and so it's about growth as a coach and things like that. So so those those are experiences that he's going to share this year and then obviously I've talked to her Michael reckoner who Michael reckoner came to the igcc.  See in 2017 and was a massive massive success people loved his stuff. If you follow him and goalkeeping development online. His work is exceptional and I was fortunate enough to spend some time with him in England recently when they're preparing for their Champions League game against Manchester City and interactions. He has with his goalkeepers. I mean, it's such a unbelievable professional so having him and having him share his vision and everything this year again.  Be fantastic and then we've also got Jason grub who's director of goalkeeping for Houston Academy. Sorry for the Houston Dynamo. So Jason, I think the other thing that we're missing here sometimes is what goes on in America, but who's working in America? How do we get our goalkeepers to go from the youth teams into these academies and follow the progression into professional path? And Jason is an exceptional Kochi works with the Houston Dynamo.  So we're excited to have him and we'll be announcing a couple more presenters in a very near future. But again, they'll be presenters who work at different levels that again different areas that are game and have exceptional expertise and we have younger coaches that listen to the podcast. So how old do you have to be to go to the ICC over 18 over 18. So if you're 18 years old freshman in college or senior in high school getting ready to go to freshman year and you're thinking about getting involved in goalkeeper coaching check out the igcc. So anyway speaking of professional  Math, let's talk about that a little bit. Let's talk about the MLS superdraft going on tomorrow and WSL draft just happened today and let's talk about some of these goalkeepers were seeing all the news. Everyone's been talking about. The last couple weeks has been Canadian International youth International Dane st. Clair at Maryland. You've gotten a chance to see a lot of him. Yeah. I've seen him a few times obviously a very very talented goalkeeper. Athletically. He possesses all the older natural talent that you need.  And if you look at the speed of the game and everything else he obviously has the ability to keep up with the speed of game which is an essential is an essential component. When you're moving from college to a professional obviously the speed of the game speed of decision making everything else is something that will have to be developed but his skill set is such that I think it can be quite successful. I've been hearing anything from you know top five to somewhere in the first round, but but it's looking like it's going to be good and looking like because he's a generation Adidas.  He's got a good shot of make it a team. Yeah, absolutely. Obviously, the international small is something that is interesting. But being generation Adidas is a great move for him. So I think that you know, who's who knows where he's going to go in a draft but he'll definitely be competing for some time. I think now Omar. I know you've seen a little bit of a dance and Claire as well too, right? Yeah. No, I I've seen a few of his highlights. He's pretty good again. I would want those guys who are very athletic to obviously proved to us that  That technically they're also very sound and I feel like do some of his highlights. I can see that I guess when you go to a big club like our big school like Marilyn, you're not going to get as much action as you would see from my guys at Michigan State and stuff like that. So the highlights aren't haven't really convinced me that he's going to be, you know, like a Stephen exact stuff inside, you know, Jump Right In to be a starter and I've seen some bad habits. He has some of the highlights he's posted. He doesn't sometimes he doesn't take his dive all the way to the ground. He kind of like punches the ball that lands on his elbow a little bit kind of like braces as fall. So that's not something I'm worried about, but that's all  I have seen in three or four of the saves that he posted his highlight safe. So I'm hoping for the best for him and I'm sure put him in the right system with a rag goalkeeper coach. I think he'll be good with the Houston Dynamo the goalkeeper coach that I've watched some of his stuff online. He's pretty sharp. I like him a lot. Yeah, so I think you just hit the nail on the head a lot of these the transition into the professional game both in MLS and nwsl the transition is critical and a goalkeeper coaching component of it becomes even more important we can't  It's a always a young guy let him learn we've got to shoot. We've got to take him now and say let's teach him to be a professional and this is this is a situation that is unlike anything anywhere in the world where you come out of college at 21 22 and someone says, hey our professional. How about that? Right? You haven't earned the right to be a professional. Someone's got to take that's that's something I think that's often forgotten. So why don't people succeed in the nwsl or in the MLS? That's because sometimes we as coaches don't take them by the hand and say, okay.  This is what it means to be a professional. These are the things you need to do. But why is that Stephen going to be so successful? Well because he went he was in college. He went into a professional environment and learned how to be a professional came back to Columbus and was a professional. Yeah that time at Freiburg really really changed things for him didn't ya again? Because he he didn't necessarily have the success that he thought he was going to have so also humbles you and teach you the ins and outs of being a professional and it's not an easy path. So, you know,  Again, just come back to your point on my will come down to a lot of hand-holding and teaching the right way about goner way of going about things somebody who's actually gone from being at a Youth Academy at the professional ranks at hertha Berlin been wound from Akron University of Akron is now in the MLS superdraft, obviously, you know, a German international not as an international as a national team keeper, but I believe he was in the Youth System at some point. What do you think of Ben? He's obviously  Big Frame hid big specimen can cover a lot of ground any draft Pro potential there over the obviously, you know, again, the international spot is something that you've got to look at and unfortunately may go against him in to a certain degree but for someone like Ben I think he was it possesses. Obviously the physical attributes again will be adjusting to speed of play which his style of goalkeeping again is different. So where does that  that fit with the style of the head coach does that fit with a silent manager and I start of each team plays and that's something that's got to be looked at. But yeah another one who could certainly make an impact in the league. Yeah. Now I'm looking forward to to the superdraft tomorrow looks like you know, obviously the superdraft is a different animal than it used to be in years past but there's a lot of especially the Internationals always get a great opportunity with the superdraft because they're not they don't have the Homegrown, right?  From an MLs Academy or anything like that and nowadays with the USL two teams, you know, they have these opportunities to go there and play rather than sit as a third or fourth on an MLs roster, you know, absolutely. Yeah, and that's and that's a bounce again as a goalkeeper coach that is important. So we've got to have these the second choice goalkeeper or the third-choice goalkeeper, make sure that they're able to get game time. And then how do you manage as a goalkeeper coach, so that's how we get better. That's how we  One is by playing games and experience. So before we go Phil if anybody wants to go to igcc working, they reach out to you. Yes, it's they can email me is very simple fill at GK one.com or go to the website, which is international goalkeeper coaches.com, very simple there are discounts available. And obviously there are worse things in the world than being in Florida for a few days. Absolutely. And if anybody wants to reach you on social media, where's the best place to do it?  Either at Phil weddin both that and that's both Twitter and Instagram or at int lgk coaches. That's the handle. Okay? Okay, and you can reach me at LA goalkeeping Academy or at Michael Majid. I'm not going to put the comedy stuff on here because again, that's that's weird. That's just weird stuff Omar. Everyone can reach you at a pro GK Academy underscore on Instagram and pro GK Academy Number 7 9 13  In to to that's all the time. We got on inside the 18 two gay guys. Thanks again to fill wet and we're out. We'll see you after the draft later. \n",

I'm Grant and I'm worried when So today we're just going to be introducing ourselves and then going over some normal Chiefs topics for this time of the year. First off as I said, I'm Grant Morse.  I actually live in Arlington, Texas. I've been a chief span pretty much hold my all my life. I was born in Independence, Missouri and then my dad took a job down here in Texas whenever I was young and we moved down here and I've lived here for the rest of my life.  I attend UTA which is the University of Texas at Arlington. It's actually about an hour and a half two hours from Patrick Mahomes Hometown. So he's actually living in the area right now. It's just pretty cool. I'll trade training in Dallas. So and tell us about yourself Ari. Alright, like I said, my name is Lori when I am from Fort Madison, Iowa, which is pretty much the far Southeast, Iowa as you can go.  I became a Chiefs fan because my dad pretty much raised me to use fan. There was really not going to be any other way. He brought me home and achieved onesie. There was really there was really no going back at that point. So we really try to make it up to one game a year and its really good time.  Yeah, for sure. So right now I'm going to the University of Iowa. So with a sports and recreation management degree. Nice. Nice. Yeah, and yeah, we try it. We definitely try to a little bit farther for us down here in Texas, but we definitely try to make it up for a game or two a year and maybe training camp so far how far is it to come up here? It's about eight eight and a half hours. And so I mean it's not it's not too bad, but it's not terrible.  Still around still double the time that I that we have to go though. It's like it's like for Nets like four and a half to get from from Iowa City to Kansas City. It's not that bad. Yeah, definitely definitely manageable manageable drive from here. All right. Now the moment you guys have all been waiting for we're giving away two free T-shirts from Mahomes 15.com, which is Patrick Mahomes new.  Apparel website, you know, some people haven't even had the opportunity to buy these shirts yet because you know, they're still in production. I got mine pretty early and I'm telling you what they are awesome my girl got my girlfriend one too, and she loves it. So our first winner is Sharon at Sharon o 8 2 for 2 at Sharon o 8 2 for 2  He's our first winner. Our second winner is Nick Crabtree at in JC for Chiefs. Nick Crabtree. Congratulations to you guys. And whenever we're done recording here, we will send over a direct message on your Twitter grabbing. Y'all's shirt size and what style you guys want? That's awesome. Congratulations guys.  Now let's get into the mailbag. We sent out a tweet Wednesday night. I believe I'm just asking a asking a few questions from the fans and told you guys we'd pick a few. So the first one is from Andrew Usher says break down the Chiefs draft options and then give your thoughts on Robert Kraft situation.  So first with the Chiefs draft options are a what do you what do you think the top three needs are for the I'd say and linebacker the linebacker position. I think we need a good inside linebacker. I'd say that we need cornerbacks really badly and not maybe four.  We really need cornerback the top my top pick if I could have any quarterback would be DeAndre Baker. I think it's serious stud for the linebacker. I don't know I go back and forth. What who would you take a linebacker? Well, I mean, I think I think hinges since we're switching to the 4/3. I think Hitchens is a shoo-in for a middle linebacker position. It's also called the mic. So, I don't know if you guys see these positions out there.  Middle linebacker Mike WL b stands for will linebacker. He's typically a smaller guy that can cover especially in spag system. And then the Sam linebacker, which is SLB. He's typically a bigger guy covers a little bit, but he's primarily there for situational pass rushing and to be a stout run Defender and you really need a guy. That is a terrific.  the stack and shed  Rush Edge guy he needs to be able to pick up the blocks from usually the right tackle. Maybe the left tackle depending on how they have the formation set up. He's got a stack and Shred those blocks to take on the running back because he's you know, he's the basically the primary run Defender outside of the tackles.  So how do you feel about Ragland then? I don't think Raglan is athletic enough. You know, I don't he might be big enough to do that job, but we haven't really seen much of Raglan over the past couple of years. You know, he he was playing on the inside and 2017 and then  I have no idea what happened to the linebackers in 2018. I mean I had I had such high hopes for for Hitchens and Raglan and they were huge letdowns. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think a lot of that has to do with the coaching though. I think that I think that they both have potential to be better and I think that they will if they if they're both starting this year. I think that they will be better. I don't know that Raglan will be but I think I think that this year.  Here they would definitely with the the new you know, defensive coordinator coming in. I think that right that'll change will see an improvement to them. But I don't know if that if raglan's the answer. Yeah, I mean at worst-case scenario. He's the backup middle linebacker behind Hitchens and we have no worries, but I think I think Dorian. Oh Daniel is a great option for the mic or for the for the will linebacker position and then the big hole at linebackers is Sam.  We I mean that's that's one of the main positions we need to Target. So I'd say sam linebacker, you know, depending on what we do with Barry. We definitely need to grab a safety and either free agency or the draft and then obviously cornerback. So going into thoughts on Robert Kraft already. What do you think about that whole situation the so I mean the Patriots always have their share of drama. This is it just I think that  Will I think that he'll get off like what I mean? They already did technically I think that he will I don't think he'll get in too much trouble just because they always seem to find a way to get out of things obviously, but you know, they often do I think that he should be suspended. I think that he should be forced to step down as we honor I don't know that I will be that's just my personal opinion about it. I think that  When when you're I don't know I think that when you are that big of a name you have to know, how are you not smarter than that then getting it? Yeah like that it got to hold ourselves to a higher standard. Yeah, it's crazy. It's like I don't know. You know that anything that you do you're in the spot. It's the same. It's the same thing as a player when they're in the spotlight like for when the whole Kareem hunt thing went down. Like I was really disappointed I was but it's  Even if whatever take you have on it on the situation that with going to talking about cream height, whatever take you have. You still have to think why in the world would you be doing these types of things when you know, there's cameras and they're so in the hotel right and the same thing for  He pled not guilty. So yeah, he plays and he pleaded not guilty. I I don't think he'll probably get off. I'll probably he'll probably need to stop praising it. That way. He will probably not get a double for it as much as you should but I think he should have to step down but that's my opinion. What about you? Honestly, I really think it depends on on what the circumstances are, you know, they evidently they were bringing these girls over for  Asia that were not exactly sure how many there were but I do know there was 1500 regular clients that were coming in and I think they released a list of like yeah. I know it's crazy and you did the place wasn't even I mean Robert Kraft if he really wanted to do that. Could you have not just hired someone? I mean, I mean really what's the deal he's insanely Rich. Why would he go to some?  Um, I think I saw somewhere it was like $59 for it is what it was. Yeah. Yeah, which Olivia it's I saw pictures of the building and it was some hole in the wall massage parlor in Jupiter Florida. Like yeah, it was pretty gross looking. I saw I was reading I read somewhere that the maximum fine that he could that he could get was like I came I was like 500 or so. Anyway, whatever. The number was also remember the exact number but equated to like two dollars for like a normal person.  So like no matter like the find they give him it's not going to affect him. You know, everything is fine isn't the answer. He the he needs to lose like lose power like lose some type of owners it like he's just finding him isn't gonna do anything. Well in terms of losing the power. I think it really just boils down to if he knew these girls were being sex trafficked, you know, I mean, that's that's really where the line is drawn if he's going in there and he's soliciting, you know, give him a fine.  I don't know if jail time is necessary, but maybe some I know the $500,000. That's the Max Fine from the NFL. Yep. That's right. That's right. That's okay. They can't go above that and it's not a matter of you know, 500,000 is still 500,000. I don't care if you have 10 billion dollars or ten dollars, you know still a lot of money even though it doesn't put a dent in his pockets. But like I said, I think it just boils down to if he knew or not if he knew then he went with the with the definitely with recently.  All the stuff sex trafficking things going on and all that if he didn't know the now it's I mean, it's still very weird situation to put yourself in if you're the owner of an NFL team, but if he did know then yeah, that's just no excuse. There's no going back from that. Like if he if you if they find out if they can prove that he knew that they were being sex trafficked then mean he should be in prison if he was given a money to make it happen or something, you know, but yeah.  No, he's buddy-buddy with Roger Goodell. So who knows what's if where this is going to end up and then let's go to the question from Jared or skog he asked would you rather have Justin Houston or D Ford? Obviously, that means Justin Houston on his current contract whether it be restructured or not at D for Don the franchise tag or an extension the franchise tag, I believe.  Is currently for outside linebackers. He would be making fifteen point six seven million fully game.  And then just in Houston, I believe they can save about seven or eight million if they restructured him that are being asked at number down to 13 million, but obviously that pushes some money down the line. So who knows that might cause some issues for 2020, especially with some other contracts we have giving it what do you think RAV4? I would be in my opinion. I would take D forward the default situation over having Houston, I think.  At Houston. I think that D4 it has a higher ceiling than Houston at this point. I think that before it is going to I mean, he still fairly young he's he's talked about how he was, you know, fine playing on franchise tag therefore this year and that I mean obviously he'll get paid at some point if he continues to produce like you did last year. I don't think that I think hewson as much as I hate to see him go is probably gone already.  Whether the penny I just don't think he'll I don't think they'll be back. I don't I think that they'll free up cap space. They'll want to free up cash basis for younger players and I just don't think that I don't think he's going to make the cut to be honest. I think that deforms the smarter option to go with did with the franchise tag and just like moving forward as far as financial aid financial goes and age-wise. Yeah. So I mean I pretty much agree with with it being D Ford.  Guy said with Houston.  You can restructure him. You can cut him or you can trade him and I think the trade option really is.  The best route here and you know the trade talks with yusin are heating up. Not sure what he's worth if he's traded. I believe the cap hit for the team acquiring him is about 14 million for  Per million for 2020 which isn't terrible, you know the chief see to eat a little bit of that with the trade. So, I mean that's not bad for a guy that's going to give you nine and a half sacks that maybe even has the potential, you know to hit double digits mid double digits. I mean 15, maybe 16 again in his career if he's in the right system. He has been relatively healthy over the past few years after the need ligament issue and  And for D Ford, I think he will be tagged but he's 28 right now, you know, he'll be 29 at the end of next season if you tagged him. Do you really want to  make that contract a four-year deal at the age of 29, you know, this guy has back issues. He's had lower lumbar problems that have come back multiple times. I think you had the issue in 2015 and then he had it again last year which actually ended his season in 2017, you know D4 had a great season. He led the league in pressures.  I think if it were me I would just I think I would give him the extension. I think I would give him the long-term deal. Now, you know if it's a three or four-year deal, you know at 16 or 17 million a year. I think that would work for me, you know, the contract would expire in 20.  After the twenty twenty one or Twenty twenty-two season in that case, you know, and then that's when that's when my home is big money, you know comes into play and I think I think you need to have D4 off the team by then, especially with you know, so you're tired and you're so young your penny you'd rather sign them now. So yeah, they are already they already have all that going and they don't have to worry about having to give him big money later on at the same time as most essentially well. Yeah. I mean if you tagged him  Okay, so hypothetically if you tag him and he goes on to have a great season, you know it if he duplicate duplicate the numbers that he had in 2018, you know his his price is only going to go up if that happens. You can't tag him again because then it's going to be like 20 something or 19-something million. You don't want to do that especially since he'll now be a defensive end. That's the rule. So if the player plays the majority of their snaps at a certain position  And they become a free agent and you're planning to tagged and they have to be tagged at the position at which they played the majority of their snaps. So or it might be 60/40 something like that. I don't know if it's 50/50 but you know, that's that's a rough estimate of the rule there. And so like I said, his number can only go up so I think I think you I think you just need to give them the extension now, you know, give him what he wants and  If of course spagnolo thanks, you know he can work with default because he's he's not exactly a fit at either defensive end position for what Spagnola has done in the past. So do you think his production will go with you saying I do you think it's production will go down his sack totals and pressure.  I mean back in 2006 and 2007, you know, that's when Strahan there's Strahan and ocu Menorah, you know, they had you know, I think that was when Strahan had the 22 and a half sacks season or whatever is insane, you know, so I mean it's hard to predict because in 2015 through 2017. He had Olivier Vernon and Jason pierre-paul, and they weren't, you know, they weren't putting up.  Huge sack numbers. I think they might have been in double digits, but I don't think Olivier Vernon was so I mean, honestly they have to be actually had a pretty decent year. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think jpp might have had a decent year before he blew off his hand. Yeah it with it. Yeah. Yeah, but I think I'm pretty sure Olivier Vernon was around like seven to nine sacks or something like that and can do they gave they gave big money to him. Yeah, and when spagnolo came back  So yeah, I think I think D Ford is the best option here. It's just a matter of how they decide to keep him looking at the other side of it for for Houston. If you do you talk about a potential trade, I've seen it a lot of people talking about the Cardinals of the potential trade auction. If you were the Chiefs and the you're trying to trade with The Cardinals, what what do you think the Houston's worth? What would you try to get from the Cardinals? I mean, I think he's worth. I think he's worth a mid-range.  Pick it really depends. I thought I would say a fourth or a fifth maybe. Yeah possibly work that up into the third. If you get a couple people in a bidding war, you know pass good to Great pass rushers are hard to come by Justin Houston's eat Sutton had them dropping into coverage, you know, a hundred and twenty times last year. So obviously that's going to bring a sack numbers down. He had nine and a half sacks. I believe nine or nine and a half.  And I think of sudden if something would have turned him loose he would have had easily 13 14. Yeah, thirteen or fourteen fifteen something like that. Yeah for sure which I think so. I think something really hurt us in that aspect. But I think I think Justin Houston still valuable. I think he's Valuable Player, you know, he's only got two years left on his deal it 14 million and then 17 million for 2020. So it mean that's really not that bad. You know, you said the Cardinals possibly maybe we could pry  And repeaters and away from them. Maybe we could do to us Houston for or just in Houston and maybe a fifth round pick for Patrick Peterson, you know, something like that. I don't think the trade be even Patrick Peterson more valuable than just needs to know my opinion at this point, but that's something I'd be interested in. Yeah, and I I've seen some people talking about how Houston's too old and that he's not worth much anymore, but I don't really agree with that like watching last year even with  With Sutton's defense. He he still showed that if there's a mismatch mismatch, he's going to heal who you still take advantage of it that game we played against the Broncos when he had what 3sat had two sacks and I say he even had a safety that was that was yeah. It was a really good game like because that their guy was struggling they're off their offensive line was struggling the entire game, but it just shows that he can still take it. He knows how to take advantage of you know situations and he can still just fly right past people with  Like little moves that you wouldn't even understand what he did have like before it happens. Yeah. So yeah, I think D4 is the answer there and then let's go to the next question from the across state lines podcast. They said what is your podcast setup? Honestly, we bought the exact same thing. We went on Amazon and we bought the exact same kit. You know, I got we just got a boom mic.  With a condenser microphone or a boom stand with a condenser microphone and then a pop filter and I just got it. That's a USB it goes straight into my computer already has the same or he has the same thing, you know, and then I just got some headphones connected to it. Then I'm listening through right now and then we will set up honestly. Yeah, pretty simple, you know cost us 55 bucks. So it's nice to start out on at least and then we we do our podcast.  On anchor anchor.com or anchor dot f m-- something like that. So yeah, it's yeah. Yeah, it's worked out. Alright so far, you know, we're having some trouble trying to get us both on the same podcast. But you know, this is our first day so we'll try to work on still working through stuff. Yeah. Yeah, we're still working through stuff. Neither of us have ever done anything like this. So what I think we're doing. All right, you know it all get better with time. Yeah for sure. Okay. So now moving  Onto the Eric Berry and Justin Houston contract situations. We kind of discussed that with in Jared's question. But as for Eric Berry man, he is one of the best safeties in the league. If not the best safety in the league when he's on the field and  I would hate to see him go financially.  I don't think it's worth it to let him go. I think I think Eric Berry is you save nine million by cutting him June 1st. And for anybody that doesn't know you can designate a guy as a June 1st cut prior to June 1st. You can designate them as a June 1st cut now, but you don't get the money until June 1st, so  That doesn't that doesn't help us throughout free agency that 9 million that we receive or a i cutting Eric Berry and you can't trade him because it's the exact same situation monetarily. It's exactly the same. So unless I mean and I don't really think he has any trade values miss the past two seasons almost entirely the big the big asterisk asterisk is he's the best one of the best cities in the league when he's healthy when he's on the field the problem the problem being is that  He hasn't been able to stay on the fever on whether the Chiefs fans go back and forth on Twitter on social media all the time, whether what to do with Barry eyeing a lot of them, but it's um, it's an emotional attachment to bury. I mean he his story is obviously amazing going through having going beating cancer coming back.  I agree with you that it's probably just not its you don't really save that much money. Just releasing them or you know trading him or anything because like you said you don't get that money. You don't the reason that everybody wants to get rid of him as so we can get in the newer players get another safety, but you can't use that and free agency unless I'd rather have the money by then. So great. You can't use that new. It's not going to benefit you. So and you're just losing one of the best safeties in the league.  Then potentially, you know what? I mean? Well not to mention that.  Even if you were to cut Barry now or prior to free agency you go into free agency with the only two Corner better only two safeties on your roster being Eric Murray and Armani Watts. Armani Watts hasn't played an Eric Murray. Has it been very good. I shown flashes but he's not he's not great. You know and Jordan Lucas is a restricted free agent pretty much a guarantee that he will be back in less. Somebody gives him an offer sheet.  But I don't see that happening. Jordan Lee goes looks pretty good as well. I just man. Oh, it's Sorenson. I forgot about Sorenson. Yeah. He yeah, but I think he's going to be cut anyway, yeah, so man, I think financially and our football reasons you have to keep buried on the roster for another season.  I think I think you just have to keep him around you know, he was up in I think it was a high or something like that with dr. Andrews and they decided that that surgery wasn't necessary and I understand how frustrating that is 40 Sands because you just want him back and either you want to back where you want to be gone. I get it and you think  But I don't think I think the doctor knows, you know Andrews a foot and ankle or Specialist or whatever he is. And I think he knows I mean maybe a little more than random cheese fans on Twitter, right? And I think they're forming their opinion off of emotion, which is fine. That's what sports is about. But the haglund's deformity it is a very tricky situation if you're trying to surgically repair it often. What happens is the bone spur is on the back of the Hill.  Hill  basically at the base of the Achilles and it rubs on the Achilles when you run or bend your foot or whatever and it causes irritation and inflates causes inflammation on the Bursa and the Bursa can rupture in the main issue here is if you have surgery they have to go in and they have to take the achilles' or at least part of the keeley's off from where it's anchored to the heel and if they do that, that means they have to reattach  It that's basically like having another Achilles repair. He could you could be out for another year. So especially if there's any complications like there was this past time and given that he's gone through six or eight months of chemo, you know, there's no telling how his body is going to continue to react to these major surgeries or where is it out. It wears you down it does. Yeah, so and I just think I think you have to keep I think you have to keep buried.  Around for just one more year. I'll I agree with that. I also just started not trying to cut you off. I think that keeping him around and then if I think we're will still draft a safety like oh, yeah. Yeah for sure. There's no reason that least sign when every agency. Yeah, there's no reason. Yeah, we're so if if you get say one from the draft and it's a young guy comes in. I don't think there's really a better safety. You can learn from than Eric Berry. I don't think there's a better one.  He's a great leader. I think that yeah would you know teach them how to do things the right way and you know, everybody on the team loves Barry like he's going to be a could be a great mentor to when Barry a fairy can only play one more year and then he needs to go then he's you know groomed this next safety. I hope hopefully we had we get a good one. And I mean, I don't think you can  You know, I don't think you can find any fault with that with that with him teaching this new safety how to do things. Yeah, and I think if you can restructure him or get him to take a pay cut somehow, I think that would be ideal push some money down the line there and lower the cap member for for 2019 and maybe add a impact player in free agency with that money that you save on Justin Houston Eric Berry.  You know, give give Patrick mom something to work with on defense because he didn't have much to work with last season. So and then stay on the field for a little bit. Yeah, for sure. And then for Justin Houston, we just talked about him. You know, we both think he's gone whether it's trade or being released. I think he's gone period you know 14 Millions a lot of money to save and  We aren't exactly.  Have a cap friendly situation going into the off season this year. I think we have twenty seven twenty eight million 7 million that so I mean Houston Houston will darn near, you know, add a third that is a third and he'll you know, add a third to that new number. So I think if you if you cut I think if you cut a few guys you can get close to 50 get to Kill Ya it goes to 50 million. If you a couple guys that I think that you could see go or like we talked about  Already Sorenson and Eric Marie, I think could go if we keep very maybe Xavier Williams is another guy that could go. Yeah, how do you feel like that on Xavier Williams? I think he had a decent here. I think they say like to point something Million by releasing I'm this year, but I think you had a decent year, you know, you had 40 something forty seven tackles or something like that. I think he had a career high and in run stops.  Had two and a half sacks, I think playing situationally, I mean he lost the starting position to Derek naughty which is you know, that's I mean that's actually good that Derek not he has already progressed and I think he's going to be a great player, but I think you have to keep Xavier Williams on the roster, you know, you got one year left on his contract and you know, he can be the backup, you know one Tech or or you know, if they go into a jumbo package.  Rundowns or something on you know, third and short they put Xavier Williams in there and put you know, Chris Jones out at end. And I mean that just gives them a boost in the Run game. Yep. So, I mean, I don't see the incentive of cutting Xavier wins because you're gonna have to go add another defensive tackle regardless. And yeah, so I think I think Xavier Williams stays sticks around, you know, he's a Kansas City guy.  But you know, I mean I wouldn't be completely opposed to releasing him. I get you know, saved 2.5 million by doing it. Yeah, but I mean you're going to have to replace that player and I don't believe in cutting players just replace them, especially whenever they were actually, okay.  So let's go ahead and transition into the Chris Jones Tyree kill and Kindle Fuller contract extensions, if you think will bring all three back.  I think that I think that Chris Jones will be back. I think Tyreke he'll be back.  The wow, I think that Kendall Fuller will probably back as well. I think that if any of them were not going to be back that would be Kendall Fuller but I can't say that for it for anything. You know, I think that if like we talked about if we  I think that tyrick he'll get a you know, he'll probably get as much his gives money soon. I don't think that you can I don't think you can do too much hard bargaining with Tyra kill. I think he's so valuable to our team. I think Chris Jones is the anchor of the defense. He's the you know, the guy that gets everybody gets them motivated get some going. I thought obviously he's talented he is the he's a beast. He's huge as far as Kindle full.  I think he played pretty I think he played okay last year. I had a look. I think I had a little higher expectations. Yeah, so night he played with the residence in the last season when he was in the slot.  But I don't know. I don't think he played terrible. I think that are  again, I think that Sutton had things set up not and then the best way for for any of the defensive players really, you know, but I think that if you keep Fuller or if you extend Fuller it wouldn't be the worst thing but I also don't know I think that if any of them weren't going to be extended it would be Fuller. Yeah, so I actually wrote an article for Chiefs Blitz, which is now NFL fan bullets.  Um, actually on Chris Jones and Tyree kills extensions. So the rule is they have to be on their rookie deal for three years. After three years. They are eligible to receive an extension. It's up to the team to trash that fourth year or keep the fourth year on their contract, which usually they don't trash it. Usually they keep it on there and then just prorate the money after that but my prediction  Actions were Chris Jones six years one hundred and fourteen point six million with 71 million guaranteed and Tyree kill at five years. Ninety three point eight million with 68 million unity and those contracts would not begin until 2020 and those numbers sound huge.  And they would actually I believe put them in the top three the tire Killer Contract might put him over Odell Beckham for the highest-paid wide receiver be a no range for sure Chris Jones. I believe would put them in the top three of pass rushers, I believe but you know, the money just goes up Chris Jones had I mean seriously 15 sacks.  Playing from a position that has never really produced sex and Sutton system. So I mean Chris Jones was just a man among boys out there. And then Tyree kill obviously we know he's one of the best wide receivers in the league over 1,400 yards. He's got like some insane amount of touchdowns over the past three seasons and I think I'm pretty sure he's leading the league and touchdowns among pass catchers and he has Seasons he led the  You candy Bowl yards and oh, yeah, but yeah, it's just a freaking and the connection between him and Mahomes is only going to get better. Oh, yeah.  So yeah with that being said on those two guys, I don't think it'll folder will receive an extension this offseason. I think he will be brought back how much I'm not exactly sure because I mean he was a little bit underwhelming in 2018. Like you said hmm. But, you know, I think I mean, I think he's a ten million dollar player depending on if he sticks in the slot or if he if he goes outside.  Just depends on where they keep him. But you know, he's a baller man. He went out there with the club. He had the cast on his hand and pass in the playoffs again. It was it against the Colts or was it in the regular season? I don't remember I don't I can picture it in my mind, but I don't know what team was again. I don't remember it wasn't it was in the end zone. He picked off a big interception with cast on his hand. So yeah, Kendall folder is I'm interested to see what Spagnola will do with him if you'll make him better you  No better than better than Sutton did I think I'd probably go out on a limb and say you will. Yeah, I'll hope so now let's move on to the combine in the draft combines going on right now as we speak either. The running backs are running their 40s as we speak or they're about to I was watching the offensive linemen earlier and I'll tell you what man Garrett Bradbury the senator from, North Carolina.  state  he is the best center Prospect. I have seen since Travis Frederick Travis Frederick is pretty much unanimous Lee the best center in the league with Jason Kelsey being a close second at least for me in Bradbury. He is a stud. You know, he I think he played  He played three different positions. He went from like tight end or something to defensive line to offensive line. And it really shows the guy is as athletic as it gets, you know, playing it over 300 pounds. He's a little under sized just under 6 3 but man, he's fantastic. And if Mitch Morse walks good Bradbury's that guy that we could take a look at in the first round. Yeah. I hate to say that because you know, it's not a sexy pic offensive line is not a sexy.  In the first round, especially whenever you have so many holes on defense, but man that guy is he's gonna be you know, he'll be a 10-time pro bowler and that's that's just the type of guy. He's he'll end up being but you hate see much more to go as well. It's because he's been such a stud but he's going to be getting he's going to get paid and real soon. But yeah if somebody yeah, I'm interested to see that as well. You know, he has been through a lot.  Of concussions and I'm not sure what that's going to have what kind of effect that's going to have on his value because with this last concussion he missed several games and when you missed several games with concussion, that's never good. That's no I mean that's never a good sign. So I mean more could be gone and if he is, I would love to see Bradbury replace him and then obviously we have to go defense for the rest of the draft but  Yeah, but I mean moving on to team needs you mentioned it earlier. We need you know, linebackers either a Sam and a will linebacker if Dorian O'Daniel can't effectively fill that will position. I think it's still be good to draft a guy to back up. Oh Daniel and let them compete. We probably need one to two corners in the draft. We definitely need a safety.  All of this depending upon what we do in free agency obviously and then I would like to see them add a running back. I don't re you know where I stand on running backs. They don't matter. Yep. I am a long-standing believer in that, you know cream hunt got cut. Everybody was freaking out, you know, oh we're going to miss playoffs now, we're not going to get the first seat and all this in the AFC and then Damien Williams went on a tear.  An absolute tear the last six games of the Season that he played it was including playoffs. He had ten touchdowns six games 10 touchdown and he was more productive than cream hunt was in any six games of his career. Jibley. I just love it. I think that Korean hi Ava I mean has a little more talent talent wise and record as a higher ceiling that they can once I think everybody would agree on that. Yeah, but the system that we put them in I think that I don't think running back to always seem to succeed with  with read as I don't think that I think you plug up almost any running back in there and they're gonna go off. I don't not dime undermining Damien's success at all, which I think he's a good running back, but that I'm just agreeing with your point that running backs shouldn't be taken that high in the draft and my and either of our opinions. Yeah. I think I think if they were to take one in round one or two, I would certainly be pretty frustrated round 3 isn't too early, you know, depending on how the board  Falls if a guy like Daryl Henderson or David Montgomery is there is the Beast yeah, I think I think they are fantastic running backs and they have the hands the receiving ability to play in this offense for sure. And I think they can be real weapons. You know, Darryl Henderson is just he came in a little bit short at the combine, but he actually came in heavier than I expected. I didn't think he'd be over 205 and he  was which is which is nice and then David Montgomery, you know, he's at as advertised. Those are those are two of my favorite guys. Josh Jacobs is probably my favorite but he's going to be long gone before we need a real yet so much Montgomery. I've had a chance of being here at Iowa had a chance to see him go up against us because he plays for Iowa State obviously and the men that you think you have him down he'll just do a little little turn and then held us be off prices again. He just like a he's just like a pinball he'll just keep  Bouncing from Defender Defender and he's hard to bring down. He's he's not tall. He's a priest. He's honestly not a huge dude. I mean, he's think he's Fightin but he's not tall. He's not like a huge tall dude. He's held us go as right through you like a kind of reminds me of Tolbert in a way member. Yeah, Mike Tolbert and a few ways. He's a little he's a little quicker than told her but he's a little more elusive but it's he'll go right through you or he can go around you to he's gonna be a salt a good  Tall back and he can catch which is yeah always a huge plus. Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying there and in Montgomery man. He actually kind of reminds me of cream hunt to an extent. I mean the guys are just hard to bring down. They have fantastic balance in my opinion. That is  Pretty much the most important aspect to a running backs game is balanced and vision. You got to see the whole and if you get hit you got to stay up period so yeah, so that's that's our needs for the draft also wide receiver and tight end won't talk much on there because you know, it's not a huge need but it is something I wouldn't mind adding. I think I think we could use.  Either a slot wide receiver a guy like Hunter Renfro, maybe at the later rounds from going on. Yeah, and then I think we need to take a flyer on a tight end in the in the you know, 5 through 7 as well, you know, because I mean with Demetrius Harris likely gone, we have one tight end or two tight ends. I guess Kelsey and Dion yelder, which I mean, I think I think  We need a backup there somebody somebody for to develop under Kelsey. No, he's getting older and I think it'd be nice to have a another weapon. And that what do you think of Fant or Hawkinson? I like Fant better than Hopkinson. I'm in the minority there. I think but no I agree. Yeah, I see a lot of people putting Hawkinson as a top 15 pick and I just I don't I don't see it. He  Fat has Hawkinson probably has a higher floor but I think fan has a much higher ceiling. Yeah, so I mean if they're not going to be around for us to pick anyway, but those are two guys that are that are pretty intriguing that will probably go in the first round. So yeah a fan water from fans obviously and IO guy and I would just watch him and he's just he's a stud like  He'll make plays and sometimes people say I really haven't seen that much from him. But that's you also have to take into account who was throwing to him.  Ladies, okay, but like easy passes that should be going to Fan every time they didn't even Target as much as I should. Yeah, they'll overthrow them all the time. I don't know how you overthrow no offense, but he was doing it but I just I think that once if fan gets a quarterback that wants to throw it to him and we'll go to him in the red. I think he'll be a monster and the red and Red Zone Target. I think that I would take him over hoggins. I'm just because of his size even alone just size alone. And I think that he has a much higher.  Our ceiling then Hawkinson does Yeah. Well, yeah, well, we'll dive into the combine and the draft a little bit more on next week's episode when all of that is is over with and then that's when ever you really start gearing up for the draft. So we'll dive into that a little deeper next week. That's good now for free agency.  Man, if Landon Collins isn't tagged. I would love to have Collins. I don't want to overpay him. But obviously in 2016 Landon Collins was a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year not he wasn't a rookie not that was 2015. He was a candidate for best defensive player in the league in 2016.  I think he was in the top five for the majority of the Season. He was an absolute stud under spagnolo. He did everything he rushed the passer. I was watching some highlights the other day. He jumped over to offensive lineman. There was a guy he jumped over the center and then a guarded fallen down. He jumped over both of them and sacked the quarterback. I don't remember who it was but the guy guys just and he's a stud. I think he'd be a real spark plug.  For this defense and if Barry is healthy you put barrier free safety you put Collins at strong safety and you have the best safety tandem in the league. I mean the best safety tandem since Chancellor Earl Thomas.  So what do you think outside of safety? What's up guy that you'd like to Target or outside of the safety? Yeah, I think that you could Target some Corner some cornerbacks would be would be decent. There's Buster screen. I think he's a decent he's I mean there and then there's bread Grimes would be it I think would be a decent Target for cornerback those two guys. Let's see. Who else  That's right.  Maybe I don't I don't know. I think that if going back going back to the States, even if you don't take Collins, I still think that Earl Thomas is interesting. Like I know you I know that I don't know what you know, what's all going to how it's all going to play out with him and his injury, but I don't know. I think that we were really close to having them last year. I think that he would be all age obviously about us. I don't know.  You don't take Collins. I think he would be a good second choice. Yeah, I think I think if Colin's ends up getting tagged and the Chiefs don't have you know, the option to go after him. I think they will Target Darby at corner, you know, he's yeah, at least he would immediately be the best corner on the team in another thing is that would really open up some options for you and the draft, you know, you could probably draft another Corner early even if you get Darby  be and then after that you can maybe draft one in the later rounds for for Deaf but and I think that one of a good sleeper sleeper picket, I could be biased being from Iowa, but I think I'm on a hooker and drop and I think he's going to be a stud. I really do think he's gonna get that. Yeah, he'd be actually I'm not a hooker kind of reminds me of Armani Watts. Yeah, they had similar skill set think hooker might be a little  Better and coverage than Watts was but they're similar players and then also believe free agency starts next week next Wednesday. So when that heats up will definitely have have more on y'all more on that for y'all next week's episode. So that's that's it for free agency right now and then just around the NFL real quick.  Antonio Brown situation, where do you think you'll end up re Antonio Brown? I think you could end up with the 49ers. I think that that's probably what if I could predict where you go, I think 49ers I've seen I've seen people say the Jets. I don't really know if that's the best fit. I've also seen that's also we're going to talk about lighting Le'Veon Bell. I think Le'Veon Bell go to the Jets as well, but I don't know I if I was to guess I'd say he could go.  Maybe maybe to the Browns the Browns are always you know, that that's an up-and-coming team. I think that yeah, you know, John Dorsey likes acquiring controversial players. So Baker to Brown would be kind of a kind of a fun team to watch. Yeah, you know Jarvis Landry there. I think I think those guys are  Think they're pretty good friends. I'm not sure Antonio Brown and Jarvis Landry so that could be an interesting option. Obviously. It's going to be somebody with you know, ridiculous amounts of cap space. Uh, and then Le'Veon Bell like you said the Jets, you know, the Browns were my favorite tool and Le'Veon Bell, but I that's not going to happen anymore. Now that they signed cream hunt.  Man, I really don't know.  I don't know. This is just such a tips tough situation because I don't believe in running backs at like I said earlier and the drop-off. I mean the Steelers had Bell and they basically said okay fine sit out a year, you know and James Conner immediately became one of the best running backs in the league, you know, and James Conner was a mid round pick I think third round fourth round something like that and he immediately matched Le'Veon Bell is production.  so  I don't think he's gonna get what he wants. I don't I don't think I think what's up, I think that another a spot for for Bell would be the Colts. Maybe I think it looks like he go to the cult. Yeah. Well, they have a lot of room. Yeah tons of room. I think they have over a hundred thousand or hundred million in cap space. Yeah. I don't think might be number one if I remember right? Yeah. Yeah. So Colts Colts and Jets man. I think those are the top two options as  Stands now, we'll see who wants to dive into that that ever-changing running back market and now all the controversy surrounding the number one pick and Josh Rosen with Kliff Kingsbury now in Arizona, would you rather have Kyler Murray or Josh Rosen as your quarterback going forward?  Well, I've seen that the Cardinal say that the Cardinals have came out and said that they're not going to be taking Marie that that Josh wasn't smart guy. I'm not buying it. You're not buying it. Nope. Yeah. Well if you're if you're not buying it and you're going to say that they're going to have both or you could pick I don't know. I that's kind of that's a tough one because I think that  I'm not sure how much I don't not sure how Murray's going to do in the NFL. I don't know II really Josh Rosen hasn't been a star for sure. I wouldn't say that it and anyway, I don't think he had the best year. I don't think he is going to be terrible. I don't know if that he's gonna be the next Carson Palmer of Arizona. Yeah, but I don't know. I think that  I think I might stick with Rosen. I think I might I might give him a chance. I don't know.  I think that you have already committed to Rosen and that.  You've said that that's your guy publicly. I don't know. I don't I don't think I don't think they'll take Marie. I assume that you have an opposite view on it. Yeah, um, you know Kingsbury obviously, he was Mahomes coach and Marie actually has a very similar skill set to Mahomes, you know, the size isn't obviously as a huge difference, but you know, those crazy arm slots the Escape ability.  The vision all of that Kyler Murray has it and growing up in DFW I was around Carla Marie. I watched him when I think three is either three or four state championships either wanted every single year three years, but I don't he never lost a game like the kid is just he's just a winner. I don't care that he's 5 5 10 and 1/8 inch. He's half an inch shorter than Russell Wilson and  You know, I would take him first overall and I would just let Kingsbury get to work on them and then moving on last few things real quick the AF American or Alliance of American football. Me and Ari are actually both San Diego Fleet fans. And after week one, they were not very good. They look like they're going to be the worst team in the league. Yeah, they were they were horrible to quote.  Tax situation was horrible and then weeks two and three the running back man. That running back is like a little pinball to you know, his doc you're talking about Mike told hurry similar that guy hit I think that oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. I think that the quarterback play is still not great for the fleet, but I think that they are going to start become a very ground heavy team because of that and I  I think that they'll I don't think that they're going to be great this year at all. I think they'll probably be pretty average cry. You know, I'd say probably 500 500 hmm But which is way better than it looked at the very beginning. I think that I think that at the beginning I thought at first I was like, oh, wow, we're really the worst team that could be. Yeah, but let the Atlanta Legends have kind of taken that role now, but it's still pissed. I think it's still I think it's really I think it's fun to watch. I don't ya go ahead. It's it's definitely getting better.  Um, it's definitely improved from week one. It is something to watch, you know, and I think it's going to get better next season when guys that fail to make NFL rosters immediately after the offseason. They're not going to go to the practice squad or maybe the NFL has some type of thing where they can play both. So I don't know we'll see and that's about it for today.  So we will be back with you guys on Friday. I'm Grant. There's on Maury and that's a week one of Arrowhead live. Thank you for listening guys and congrats to Sharon and Nick on the t-shirts will see you guys next week. Thank you letter. \n",

Yeah, it's summer just surprising right some guys, you know, just have a good story some guys you kind of Wonder and then some being good. Right? Right. This one. I don't think we got a wonder I was gonna say like I say that every week because kind of the script, let's be  Honest, but this one I heard just about 30 seconds of before we actually started and I'm pretty excited about this one. Yeah, it's like the Coast Guard Crews cool the post goes characters cool Ryan. They're all somehow connected right now. So it's pretty awesome who we got on the line Mr. Dan surely born in Kirkland, Washington raised in Ketchikan Alaska doing the Coast Guard Back in 1970 with recruit company Delta seven. Seven first unit was the Coast Guard  Her modok out of Coos Bay, Oregon. I was an ocean-going tug went from there to slip Point light and the Straits of Juan de Fuca and then station chetco River serve station before he was released from active duty and went on to become a treasure hunter, right and undersea treasure Hunters. Oh what an awesome career. He also you know before Bill asked the question he he was a police officer in Washington Alaska and the way that I noticed him, right?  It was a post to the Coast Guard surfman page of him see new song that he wrote just for you know, like to commemorate his service. Oh really going to song during live. I am hopeful that we get this. All right, we tried to get him here alive just didn't work out with timing and location, but hopefully we can get him to do it here. Right? We'll see ask him that after you asking the question. I then with that being said, what's what's the most dangerous?  You're a pixie story or stories. Well, I suppose one of the most unique things that I was able to do is take the 44 footer the four four three one one end over end on the chetco River Bar in January of 1974. They came while we're upside down. Yeah. Well, it was an e-ticket base. They had e-tickets back then. Okay. So anybody from that era would understand an e-ticket?  At Disney, but anyway pitch pulled my boat took my crew over the falls and while we were upside down another breaker hit the boat as it was starting to write itself and it ripped my coxswains tear out of the deck and threw me over the side with a chair strapped to my ass. So by the store the seatbelt works. So, you know, I I'm sinking to the bottom of the Pacific and January and I know I'm off the boat. I just  Really understand why I have no idea which way is up because I my eardrum imploded for the from the quick drop, right, you know the depth and flooded with seawater and Diesel because when the boats upside down it's a few can diesel through the air vents on the engine room. Anyway down there have no idea total vertigo and I go to kick I didn't know which direction but all of a sudden I'm kicking the pedestal of the chair off.  Or footer so I'm going well, that's probably not good. So I fumbled around undid my aircraft harness, which is the three-point harness, you know, you wearing a 44 and once I drop that my life jacket brought me back up to the service or service surface. But yeah, it was it was a fairly close call. Yeah unreal - so, okay. We're going to take this one back right real simple step-by-step this one so young I'm guessing bm3.  Right. Yeah. I was BOCES me third class. I was bulletproof. I was you know decade man. I loved I loved the job. So you're in station. You've done a little time. You get a little bit of see time under your belt by this point what let's let's will go all the way back right will build up to it. So Coast Guard Cutter modok ocean-going tug. What was your job on that thing? I was very Seaman apprentice and I got Scene and while I was there and then was striking Bose and Smee. I didn't want to be below.  Load X and the Modoc would go out and check we did mostly will search and rescue and fishery patrols. So we'd go out to the 12-mile Limit and spend two weeks from Canada all the way down to the California border and check the Russians out there sucking up all of our fish and making sure they weren't inside or territorial limits. Do you ever do anything about it when you found them? Oh, yeah. We did a lot of stuff out there and we did a lot of search-and-rescue.  You the Modoc got it, which it couldn't get out of its own way. But it it could go around the world twice with a fuel it had on board. It was so powerful. It could pull the cork out of the bottom of the ocean with a hell of a boat, but it was like a it was like a bathtub, you know, the hull one of the worst writing boats in the Coast Guard if I fish would fart this thing it take a 40-degree water like a bobber and a bathtub. Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.  And then so from there. So did you you just completed the tour? They gave you like a short tour and you went to slip Point light. Well, I did my I did right at a year on modok. Okay, and then and I got slip point there on the Olympic Peninsula and Washington State and it was the first Lighthouse that's inside the Straits of Juan de Fuca and it goes way back to the 1800s, but it had been the main Lighthouse had been replaced.  Update our and stuff but the old Gantry of the Walk that you had to take over the ocean to get out to it was still think one so it was precarious at best getting back and forth. But that was where the Coast Guard allowed me to become a diver. So and that's kind of the whole on lit up my life after that. I'm trying to understand this then so like the the lighthouse itself or to get to the light you had to walk what like over a cliff and like a cross.  Like a bridge basically to get out to it or yeah. Yeah. It was a Gantry was that it was a crosswalk that was made over the rocks and the water. Okay. So it was it was an elevated platform with boards, but it was gosh close to a half mile long and you had to walk all this way out to the light and then the light was a it wasn't a structure. It was just  Iron and stuff so you'd go out there and you have to you know work on it, whatever whatever it took but if it was and there were three of us on the station there was a first class in charge and then there was an engineer and then there was me and at that point. I was third class bosun's mate. You're a legit like Lighthouse Keeper, right? Right, like just a more modern version right U didn't whole time. He gets more the oil better down at chetco. Yeah.  All right. Well what so at the light where did you guys work? If it didn't have a structure was there just a how did that work? Well, what we had was we had the old housing unit that we all lived in back at the main and it's the same one that was there for, you know a hundred years, but it was just the Old Lighthouse itself they'd replace and it was out on so the lighthouse was never something they lived in it was always a fairly.  Small structure, but I don't know if you've seen those what it's Twilight movies and stuff like that. It was a man Wayne movie. I won't admit whether I've seen you're not my wife mind. You're going to them you're going to love this John would bring the wild goose up there and I actually got to dive for keys off of his boat there at OC Q Harvard over John Wayne's keys. I did for a fact that saw since you find them.  Wasn't on the boat at the time and I've heard since then that he has been so disappointed that he never got to meet me. So I believe that understandable because I got to meet that guy who pitched pull the boat. I hadn't pulled the boat yet. How was it? How did they light that thing back then?  The White House? Yeah, what was it? Like, what was it batteries and a yeah. Yeah. I know. It was all electricity and stuff like coming. This is and 71 72. Well, hello, I mean it like in the 70s to me and like guys will sign a three-man section assigned to a light Lighthouse is very different than today. Yeah, for sure. I know I know everything is dry. Hey, I look at your guys 47s and I'm going really really  Well, it's okay. So from slip Point light you were able to escape and then to get to the chetco river tell us about chetco River of 1970s. Well, you know chetco was absolutely amazing. It's fairly narrow bar. It's the variance of Brookings, Oregon the very last town before you hit California. So we were right on the california-oregon border. Alright on the southern border of, Oregon.  And we also pulled the Gold Beach Patrol at Rogue River in the summertime Rogue was closed in the winter. It's just got too bad. But we pull the summertime Patrol up there with our boats as well. And it was it was just phenomenal duty, but it was nasty water. Who was who's in charge of the station Don McMichaels the I don't know if you've seen any of his painting some of them are in some of the best museums in the world.  Hold right. Now, I'm looking at two of them charcoal drawings that he gave me on my wall right now. But Don McMichaels was in charge and then Stanley Smith was my ex. Oh, I took him over the falls with me, by the way. Oh good. It's not a good way to be upwardly mobile. You know in the Coast Guard wasn't your check ride or anything was it yet? Why is it always that it was it was I was supposed to I had everything filled out that damn.  Coxswains book and he was taking me out. Okay, let's go out do the that was a nasty day. Right and we were coming across we were on the bar or close to it. And it's breaking all the way across which wasn't you know, I mean again chetco was a fairly narrow bar. So it wasn't that big a thing, but you count the series and what I mean by that for people that me and understand wave Breakers they come in a series.  And then there's a lull between the series and so if you time it right you can come in and that law and get across without having a big-ass wave on your Stern, right? Yeah, you know the whole like everybody loves the photos of surf Ops, right, but the actual intent is to avoid the waves, right? We don't actually want to surf exactly or if you're going into them. Then what you want to hit is the suds and not the green water. You want to let it break get that because that's all water it's bubbles.  Right, but you don't want to hit that green water. That's what breaks things including people. So anyway, I'm coming in. I've got the series counted I hit the throttles now a 44-foot motor Lifeboat lot like the Modoc. I think we've taught speed was 13 knots. I mean, it couldn't get out of its own way. Just very powerful. We're coming in look on my Stern. Here's a huge-ass way of building and I'm going it's a rogue wave. It's not supposed to be there and it's very large so I can't beat it.  Across the bar, so I start backing down thinking if I can get on the back of it. I can surf it across the bar. Well, I got on top of it and then it broke at the well deck of the 44 and when it did whole front end of the boat just went straight down and then the wave pushed us all the way over man. I mean pitch full is the most scary thing. I think you do. It's just scarier than a rollover in my absolutely God. Yeah, you know rollovers a fairly  Yeah, and I mean so many in my coastie buddies and stuff like that. They've rolled a boat or they've been one that's been better than a hundred eighty over or something like that. You know, we've all dip the rail and stuff but man to pitch pull is a different Critter. Yeah when it when it goes over the narrow Direction you can kind of go. Okay, that makes sense but to pitch pull it that's crazy. That's a long wait, right if anybody doesn't understand what we're saying. That means you went end over end. Yeah, you put your number and I'd wait you didn't just roll.  Go to the side and then keep going you with end over end. Yeah, well and you know, honestly I was there to impress my XO and I thought well if I'm going to be pressing, why don't I just go ahead and put it on his lid, you know will pop back up everything will be fine. And then I'll have got everything that could possibly be in that coxswains check cause he was probably just impressed you'd lived after I wasn't sure he was going to come back over and get me. I popped up out of that chair and my  Crew of the boats upright my Crews looking for me and I kind of try to wave at them. My shoulders are all messed up and stuff like that from Beth. Can you imagine bouncing around in that coxswains flat but that chair strapped to you? Yeah. It was like a beef in a boxcar man. I got the crap beat out of me how many steering stations is a 4044 have was a 2 or one just white, right? Yeah, just one. Yeah, so he had that you got them. You got the ones today with the with the one on the Flying Bridge and then you got one I believe.  All right, right. Yeah, you actually have to hurry you got ya to on the Flying Bridge and then to helm stations down below. I think one throttle though. Wow, that's amazing. Yeah, and that the one of the things I really hate is sellers. I didn't get there to actually get on board because I want to write on one of those so badly. Well, you know, the invitation was still open, right? All right, I appreciate that the so basically so you so taking it back real fast you  You Broach down the surface of this way. Right right down the face like you were going. Oh, no, no, no no back. I wish no no III was backing into it hoping because it was still just green water is still just a I got is about her to backing down in front and then letting yeah break in front of you and then it caught you. Okay so far as hoping it would it would break around the bow someplace so I could wide the back of it then and I could surf it in right but instead of breaking  Where I hoped it would it broke it by well deck which put all of my weight too far forward. And so I just went straight down the bow just did a I mean I could see the bottom. We just nose pointed down straight and then you know, you got a 40 mile an hour wave on your butt itch push sober and what so how did they come and get you they come and get you pretty quickly. Oh, yeah. I mean once I pop back to the surface, I think grab this.  See what the hell I went. They knew the chair and I were gone. But did you hear what did they ever get the chair back? You know, they didn't and I bet they're still trying to charge me for that. They're trying to get the we're diving back for know what happened. You know, what happened those fellows they found out that because of my accident all the chairs on the 44 is in the Coast Guard. There was reverse electrolysis happening to the bolts. They're using stainless steel bowls.  In an aluminum deck in the aluminum chair go Dan put in put a good spin on it good. I like it. Well all I am. Alright, so see you were just a guinea pig. Damn. I'm not a screw-up you're letting the circumstance and the firt know, I'm the first test pilot for an ejection chair on a 44-foot motor Lifeboat and it never caught on right. I wonder why well, so once the check ride was over do they  I'll fight ya did you pass the check right? That's the real question boys. This is so we're and I believe Stanley must've hit his head. I believe Stan Lee must have hit his head because I figured at this point. I'm a cook now and he did he signed me the hell off and made me a coxon and leader is surfman. That's awesome. What a different Coast Guard right? I'll tell you what ya know the stuff we did.  Places we went and you know, I mean and we were young and bulletproof and those days and what a what an incredible life it led me to who I am today and the things that I've accomplished ex post facto because of those great alliances that I made in the Coast Guard another was Muslim if he keeps using like Latin and big words and I'm he's a treasure hunter Dan. I know I mean beside for those old maps and stuff, you know.  Can you guys do subtitles on this? Yeah it we might have their own that's good. I'm sure you'll have a few disclaimer, right? So, what was your first case after you got your letter?  Oh God, you know I had a I had a tuna boat. That was it was badass whether I had a tuna boat that was taken on water about close to 100 miles offshore, you know, tuna boats run run deep.  And the 44 is don't have a lot of fuel. I mean, you know, you can go for a while but a hundred miles off a hundred miles back pretty much is going to be beyond your area of expertise, but we went out anyway, and then there was a boat out of your eyes.  Another fishing boat standing by with them on my way out. Well, the water was so bad. These guys gotten kind of Dire Straits and they shift their Rudder that it broke it and so it's stuck in one position. So now I've got two fishing boats out there that are better stock and needing assistance. So once I get there, I send a P250 pump over to the sinking boat and my engineer and we got the sink and taken care.  Care of so that they and they were still able to get underway, but the one that shipped their Rudder we could do anything except I put a drogue out on the stern of their boat and I told them and I escorted the sinking boat back in we got back.  That's awesome. Right? I mean awesome, right? Yeah fumes get back on fumes like no fuel left. I'm sorry. I said you get back on fumes. It sounds like like do you get no fuel left at that point? Yeah. Yeah. No. No, they actually had to come out from chetco and hook onto my boat because I was out of fuel went on in my boat and the other boat and Tow them and get us in that way. So I didn't make it back with the fuel I had but I got close enough that we were able to get everybody home.  Unwrap on a small boat. That's something you don't hear very often will do what a solid first Cox and case right we get to we get to pull the pump out right buddy water the boat. I'm actually going to use a drogue which you know, like the few and far between and then I'm going to run out of gas, right you know it and know it before I lie ahead of time go right out of gas even further back. What was your first case?  At station chetco River like even when you first got there. What was your first exposure? We had a we had a fire on a boat in the harbor believe it or not, and it was a fire and explosion and one of my best friends and an engineer O'Leary Haas was on my boat stuff. He jumped onto the burning boat to try to  Because he was going to burn other boats tied nearby. So he hopped on to put a line on it. We're going to drag it off and take the lines off that were on it. And as he was on there it exploded and blew him overboard and I was able to recover him. We pulled the boat off and stuff like that. Unfortunately a couple of folks were below decks, but they've been spraying urethane foam and something, you know in the hall or the hold and something sparked and whole thing went up.  That's crazy. What a good chetco River. You knew what's up? How about on? How about on modok? Any any cool, you said you guys did a lot of search-and-rescue on there and a good story. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The last time I was the last Patrol I was on the Modoc we'd been out for two weeks, and we've just coming back across it was December 1972 and we were just coming back across the Earth. I'm sorry 71  You're just coming back across the Coos Bay Bar coming home for Christmas. And we got a search-and-rescue. Hey, there's a 700-foot Greek Lumber freighter that has shipped its cargo and its listing at about 15 degrees and they want to abandon ship and there up above and coover Island Canada. Well, we're down in Coos Bay, Oregon, but there was no other  Coast Guard boats in betwixt us Merry Christmas. So now underway other way you got it. So we literally turned around on the bar and went back and headed up and there were 1,200 miles at Sea. Wow, how long did that so we could do several days just to get to them once we got there the Seas will close to 40 foot. They were mountain and we're up there and  Where we see this boat and it's listed so far over that it ship and water with these huge waves and the lumber was banded and on the deck and so big chunks of it at ripped loose from the deck and we're floating everywhere in the water and each band of this Lumber was a size of a house and they were coming around errs and stuff like that and it turns out I was number one designated swimmer for the boat. So these guys wanted to abandon ship.  I would have to go in the water to try to save anybody that you know, so it kind of a death sentence. Really. Yeah, gothic art our captain talked the captain of the Greek freighter into not abandoning ship and we plotted a course that would quarter the swell and the nearest Port we could get into with that with that courts was San Francisco. So we went all the way from Vancouver.  In order to San Francisco escorting this boat with this massive list and we got our under the Golden Gate the couple days after Christmas awesome. That's we've got a lot more this episode to go and we'll get right back to it after this short ad from our sponsor.  We're going to give you a key number about the future National Coast Guard Museum. And that number is 5 there are five themes storylines Lifesavers around the globe enforcers on the Seas Defenders of our nation champions of Commerce and Protectors of the environment the exhibits and galleries in those story lines will be showcased in a five-story museum and here's our favorite five for as little as $5 a month. You can be a plank owner and support construction of the national Coast Guard museum for details on how you can.  Involved go to Coast Guard Museum dot org slash out. That's Coast Guard Museum dot orgs /o UT cool. I want to hear how you mess with the Russians. We didn't mess with him. We'd come alongside weird them. We have to go forward and get typically if we assumed or thought they might have been inside the six months we go on there and we start trading crap with them. They love skin mags and stuff like that so we get aboard.  We trade you had to have a few to I'm sure they didn't have any violent. I didn't but I knew why you were in the Coast Guard what got you in the diving?  It's something I always wanted to do. And while I was on the Olympic Peninsula there at slip point at the light station. I was way out by Neah Bay and stuff like that right at the mouth of the or close to the mouth of Juan de Fuca. The point was it was out by Neah Bay. Yeah. Yeah. It's just the next Coast Guard Station in from Neah Bay what was needed and had to back back in the day. I mean was it?  Guessing nothing's changed. It's still pretty remote and oh God. Yes. It was at the very end of the Maca Indian reservation. And you had Neah Bay and then right next to it tattoo shilin where there was the huge Lighthouse the very first one before you come into slip point and then I was at the one the second one inside the very first one inside. It's still do wailing back then.  Not there. No not there. They did up in Barrow though the whole time I was there. Yeah. All right. Sorry. So diving we're its low Point. Yeah, I miss Lipp point and I wanted to become Coast Guard diver and I've been scheduled to go to Treasure Island to the Navy UDT, but they something fell through couldn't do it. So they told me hey, there's a dive instructor company and it was now a  Are you I in Port Angeles so I could go there. Let's go started pick up the tab and then go ahead and meet me at Coast Guard diver. So I went in and got my certification in Port Angeles and was a diver over science. Awesome. That's cool. Yeah. Well, we were there any requirements of the program like back back then I don't even know. I mean now we have a formal rating of divers, right? It used to just be exactly and and I actually have a dive pin from being a coast guard diver, but  But what they mainly did the divers for back in my day was a teacher's UDT we go in an icebreaker and then we be the ones when they couldn't bust through something that would go underneath the ice and set charges to bust it up. So the Icebreaker could get through it. I just learned that that was a thing dude. That's a heck of a duty to volunteer. Right? I love you Dynamite ice. You know what they do now right Dan, I don't they, you know, like for  Dirty and stuff. I'm pretty sure they just hug pilings until you find something that might explode right and then you were working at least at least the piling. Uh, hey, they recover a tan batteries dude you I know the guys when I was diving. I was still using neoprene. Is that a bad thing? I don't even know what that's a wetsuit. Like you guys don't even have dry skin is dry suits. They use dry socket now blowing up like yeah. Yeah, that would be a problem. I could see that. Yeah for sure. Hell they even  And use capillary suits, you know, I we had to use those and when I was diving in the high Arctic my Crews would have to be in a capillary suit because you priest it at that water is 28 degrees again went back towards the flesh taken again with the big words to express what it is, but what's a capillary suit? All right. Well capillary suit is where you have capillaries you have lines going through the suit and then you run warm or hot water.  Through those lines. Okay, so hito basically I got ya heated suit. Wait. Wait. Yeah good diver. Do yeah. Well damn before we get into your post Coast Guard career and we continue on with the diving. Give me give us a couple of like the life lessons that you got from the Coast Guard like what were your biggest takeaways?  My biggest takeaway is that you have young man you have man and it was all men. Then I'm not being you know, anything bad about the ladies but we didn't have ladies in the Coast Guard. Then there was an auxiliary thing called sparse that you know, we had ladies in but none of them were at our stations. None of them were out in the boats with us or anything like that. I'll watch change that did when I was a police officer as well.  But I had men I had people that I knew that I have still have is incredibly incredibly close friends including that knucklehead that wrote that boat upside down with me and still made me a surfman my ex. Oh, so if anything it taught me Reliance it taught me to a certain degree bravery you accept what you have to do and then you go out and do your best to do it doesn't always  As mean you're going to come back but you realize that you understand that and yet you'll still go and that's that's I don't know probably anything I got from the Coast Guard was that the Friendship the comradeship and then the self-reliance just that I can mentality.  Love it would answer one question on having to go out. Right? Right. What do you think? What was the drive for you to always go out other than the regulations like I mean anybody could say no to regulation you have you're going to get in trouble, but I doubt it was the punishment Factor, right? What made you want to go out? Because you believe that your skill and your equipment would bring you back in.  And hopefully the people you're going out to rescue and more than anything else. That was what it was. It was that that and it's the same thing with Coast Guard of the I see these kids go out and use helicopters and stuff like that still doing things that Common Sense tells you don't do that. You know, I mean, we don't go out unless it was you know, somebody else was in trouble they went out when they shouldn't have now. We got to go save their bacon, but we did that we  except that it and honestly, we just rejoiced in it. At least I did.  Hundred percent. Yeah, well said, yep the potential to make a difference right? That's exactly exactly I mean, you know and you're going for folks. You don't know you've never seen. Yeah, I mean you'd have no vested interest in you know, no emotional, I guess interest you have a you have a an interest in yourself your abilities of trust in your crew and in your equipment and you go out.  Out and get you the best damn thing. You can to mitigate a bad situation. I do have a question to turn off the seriousness. But did you trust your equipment a little bit less after the seat ripped off out from under you you put him on an RBI as a result of all the chairs in the Coast Guard were suffering from the same problem and that the bolts were all partially eaten up you should have got in store.  By an actual boat Alt from the from the commandant, right? They changed all the chairs in the Coast Guard as a result of my accident. So still a thing. I'm Dan like yes pilot. I'm not just a test pilot, but I'm out there save another guy's life, right? Yeah. You should have gotten a Commendation Medal out of that. I think let's do a thing like if you if you start at ECT, oh, you know, if you're responsible for it or like an all Coast, I mean, you're kind of a legend after that point. Yeah. What?  I'm kind of a legend. You know, I'm more of an antihero. I'm a poster child for what not to do. But at the same time, you know, I survived and paste some of the things came out of it God and I wish we had you right now. I wish we had a young young Dan right underway on a 29 RBS to and you could just you could show us all kinds of things. We would be able to keep it PG-13. I'm sure they could be gone. Yeah. Oh man. I have one more question about your your pitch pole. Like you said it was a rogue wave.  In hindsight and obviously with more experience after that. Is there anything you should have done differently there or was that just one of those that was going to happen and you couldn't do anything about it kind of things. You know, I've done this I've done this hindsight so many times right? I'm sure her incident plus it was right at the bar. So I got a guy in semen up in my high tower, you know the bar watch and hear a three Storey Tower looking and Counting the boats coming and going he watched this whole thing and he saw  Building on this turn but it wasn't there and it was the series I've counted three or four of them and then I made my run-in. So no this thing built out of nowhere. It just showed up and I don't know I I wouldn't have done anything different. I mean II trusted what I've done and honestly I completely thought I could get this thing underneath me and surf again, I just had no idea what's gonna break or  it did boy when it did that it was something you know, what's funny about that funny story about that. So like we had a neck so XPO right one time and he was very he was most professional Mariner I've ever seen right like that. I think he was on honestly under the belief that if you do everything by the book and you're constantly locked on like that stuff will never happened dude, then one night in the Potato Patch Shoal completely proved wrong. I really like the ocean just does weird stuff some right?  New there's no you're not coming back. You know, you're not you can't you can't just make that go away. Like it's going to hit you. Well, that's kind of the reason I asked them like one. I'm sure I'm sure you you went over that in your mind a million times probably right after it happened and probably over the years because it's definitely not something you forget. And that's that's some people need to know like stuffs just gonna happen sometimes think about what you know, sometimes you gotta hang on for the ride, you know what I mean? Yeah. Well, yeah it does and then you go back to our training and  the fact nobody panic my crew was all strapped in and stuff like that. I was strapped in and I just didn't expect the thing. I was strapped into to evacuate the boat I evacuated to but that's different stories. He was understand why because I'd read all the  First I knew the boat was going to self right? All right, I talked to McAdams. He'll he'd been over the you know, rolled those things over a couple of times. He did it on purpose I say okay. This is going to come back up. I just got to hold my breath. I'm fine and I'm off the boat. So that was the weirdest part of it. And that entice when that thing went in Dover in I was looking straight down at the bottom because it sucked all the water back, right what's you know, men like even going to  We have a dunker school now Dan that's like it puts you in the cabin of a boat and then they roll it right cool. And and then you have to find your way out. Yeah, you never us out but like you as as it's turning, you know, the first time I was ever in it was like, I mean, I've been driving boats for 15 years at that point, right and then you see your office go underwater and even knowing it was coming. It was still disorienting. Yeah that I had five years on at the time like that particular Hall. Yes.  See when you're upside down. Yeah, it's not like an insurmountable problem. But you definitely like like man, this is weird, you know, so I can I can only imagine being strapped to the chair and in the middle of middle of some white water not knowing what's going on. Well again the guys, this is January in the Pacific Ocean. So I mean I'm sinking in ice cold water. I've been underwater for a while already because of the pitch bowl and now I'm off the boat and I know I'm sinking but I don't know which way down is  Because I'm total vertigo. You guys understand that for just a flip you're doing but I had no reference. I had absolutely no reference where I was at. I was in the Pacific and yeah, it was it was any time slows down. Oh, yeah time definitely. Yeah for sure. So I had all this time to kind of think about everything that was going on and quite honestly I didn't and I think by diving background had a lot to do with it, but I  Never panicked. I never had I panicked I would have died. Right but once I started kicking and felt the pedestal and Care realized I was still strapped in and I realized well, I got to undo the seatbelt. And so I did dropped it and when a chair let loose then my life jackets remember those well, maybe you kids don't those big old Kpop orange life jackets we had in I can honestly say I've never worn a tape. I know what you're talking about, but no us kids don't remember.  Anyway, pop me back to the surface and Stanley saw me and standing up. He drove the boat back over and suck the cock sand back aboard. That's awesome a great story to in a lot of Let It Go and it kind of Full Circle in the the post Coast Guard life, you know police officer for a while diving on some shipwrecks one.  The shipwrecks in particular has a coast guard connection. Could you can you tell us about that one? Yeah, I can in 1897. I started while I was a police officer up in the Arctic Alaska for the state troopers and the North Slope Borough Police Department all the Eskimo villages on the very North End of the laska idiot thousand square miles. We had nine Eskimo villages we were responsible for but while I was up there  They're doing my Cop Shop thing. I also recognized that there were these buildings homes, but they were perfect replicas of deck houses from 1800 ships, you know, the 1800 era and I question I said, hey, why would somebody replicate something? Oh, it's not replica. We took them off the boats that were the same here and they were perfect that they  Living in them. I mean and nothing had wanted nothing had went away their hundred and fifty years old, you know and nothing they were perfect. So I started researching found out that there were over 70 whaling vessels that sank in the high Arctic Alaska over about a 60-year period and my my diving background kicked in so I started a project called Orca the ocean research center of the Arctic and one of the  Aster's that happen was in 1897 where eight Boats were trapped up there eight whaling boats in Point Barrow and they couldn't get out and they were going to die of starvation. There wasn't enough food and Point Barrow in the Arctic, you know in the winter to feed these guys, so they sent an over array rescue Expedition and the Coast Guard will the revenue cutter who is revenue cutter service.  But the revenue cutter bear was tasked with going from San Francisco up to Point Barrow and saving these trapped Whalers by now because this incident happened in September by the time that they're got underway, it was November and so the pack ice was all back in. They got to a place called Cape Vancouver on the Alaska Coast and that's as far as they could go because the pack guys, so the  The captain of the bear put two of his lieutenants to Shore and they bought six hundred head of reindeer from some laplanders in the area and then hired Natives and the coasties drove these six hundred head of reindeer just like you would a cattle drive 1,600 miles across the Arctic and the dead of winter and got them to Point Barrow in January is saved all of these people that were trapped up there.  Yeah, and one of the I mean one of those people was the future first coming on the Coast Guard, right, right. That's right. I forgot. Yep. Yeah. Yep, then dive. I'm looking at his book right here. I've learned that. I've got an original yet first bird house and Gardens. I've got the yellow rental book here with the math in it. So it's got the map. Yeah, very cool.  So did you ever find these boats? I found some of them I found boats from the 1871 Fleet. I'm looking at artifacts from them now and I brought them back and I got with a National Association of corrosion Engineers because there's this phenomenon and of course why we say, of course all of the shipwrecks that I'm interested in are on the land bridge that existed prehistorically between Asia and North America and so it's called beringia.  And it's like they're on a cement parking lot out there that Sand Shell and gravel the that covers the Arctic Ocean in that area goes down to about 15 inches and then it hits permafrost. So these things there's nothing growing on them. It's like cryogenics are perfectly preserved. So I've got things here that late on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean 450 200 years that you could build out of right now. They've been out of the water since the  80s 80s and 90s and they're perfect unreal. That's cool unreal. I can't believe you were still living in the Pilot House, right? All right, I'm sorry. I can't believe the people were still living in the Pilot House is up there. Oh, yeah, no way. It is absolutely amazing. It's what tripped my trigger to doing this whole thing is because I couldn't believe it either it made no sense until I started doing the research and oh Lord, that's really cool friends crazy. They you saw the house.  Like man, that doesn't look right and then it it's Spurs This treasure hunting Adventure up there. That's a that's awesome Dan. Well, I was drinking at the time. So I wonder if it'd be sober I'm a bosun's mate. You know, we do that. Well Dan, I know you you wrote a song man. I mean, that's how I found you initially right? Yeah. Can we get you to sing it?  Oh, all right. We can try it on the phone Jesus guys. Give me I'm not. Alright, I sing like I don't know. I heard a man. I like I mean if nothing else the lyrics are cool, you know, even if you're not I'm just kidding your voice is good too. Okay. Well just for the listeners if they're interested in the words and stuff like that pacific currents newsletter the West Coast magazine for Coast Guard.  Yep, they they want ahead and publish dirt back and 2017 in September of 2017 in their magazine it obviously it's not singing but it's the poem that brought the singing about very close down. All right, I can try this. Let's see how  Your gutters, they're not the US Air Force the army or Marines.  You must go out but not come back is the model that we use spend their days in Pounding waves can be difficult recruits coming from Coastal States land block.  Did you find the make a difference and certain that they do they trust the stars and cross apart the US Coast Guard but then one night the waves grow tall the winds begin.  The Swarm the weather Gods getting greedy introduced The Perfect Storm ship sucks your are sinking.  What else can we do you call the folks with rescue boats? The US Coast Guard the waves are moving now Krista White with foam our crews plow out into the he'll bring the victim's home if they make it back there lucky.  Not all the Caesars do but they know the score and then go back for more. It's a smallest US service you provide security for Mariners around the world such as treating century.  Projectors of the Waterway for the many by the few the risk their soul to keep you hold the US Coast Guard from the decks of Life short Cutters. They're not the you as serpents Force the army or  You must go out but not come back as a model that we use. We spend our days and pounding ways were the u.s. Coast Guard.  Thank you.  What are y'all doing? Yeah, that's also right. I like that whole song Dan. My favorite part is he doesn't even mention the Navy in there. I don't know the Coast Guard spurred me to write that. But yeah, I find it inspiring. It's cool. Well, you know, I was looking around for a song that all right, so I know what die that new very Sadler. You know, he  Is nope very Sadler, which the Green Beret guy that wrote follow the Green Berets and smother sounds like that. That's why it sounds kind of familiar. Yeah. Yeah fighting soldiers from the sky anyway, so I'm sitting here one night and Scotch was involved, but I only invest time and it was good scotch. Bye guys. My mom looked up songs.  The Coast Guard I'm just going to see what kind of songs we got. Nothing. I couldn't find anything that kind of told what we did out there or have none were we had none day and now we have one I'm singing nothing. I can't part with the kids. All right. Well, you know what, I'd love to do boys because your and I can't sing and I can't play I beg to differ. It's kind of like other things on me. I it makes me happy if I could find somebody I would love to have this.  Thing the Coast Guard could Embrace that they could enjoy a few think if you think it's because I've had a lot of guys that have told me is and they really liked it and stuff not my rendition. But if we had somebody that could do it well.  You know, who knows? Who knows who's going to listen thing? Let's see what happens. It sounds like a country singer will be good for that. Like no, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm like I'm thinking about it's definitely campfire song. Oh, yeah, you know your head John Wayne casserole talk about him twice probably but it's amazing do but if you're like sitting around the Cameo, we've got John Wayne toilet paper aisle, they split yeah doesn't take anything off of anyone. Yeah. So that's one for all the listeners though. If anyone's listening anyway,  One or you know someone that could professionally record this song. I don't know if you can one of Dan but if you can try, you know, give him a call. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. I know II would I mean this this is not really ego is that this is just something I would like to have for I'm proud of everybody out there that you know, all of us should have put ourselves, you know behind the people we have to go out and say it  I'm proud of that.  For sure, Dan, you're one of our best guess today man everybody if you're aware in here you come and get live with us. Okay, I'd love to do that boys eye. I'm better live as long as as long as it's not you know, like picture Li don't worry about my Scotch. Okay? Yeah. Hey, I'm here. Well, hey anybody that's looking for you can just search Dan surely on Facebook. Right? I know you're a member of a bunch of different Coast Guard groups.  On Facebook, so it should be easy and just start quick correction. So it's shairi as I reaiiy. Oh, I know. I'm sorry. You told me the long i, that's that's my fault. I'm sorry, if you don't spell it, like surely without the really unique name. Just like the man that sling is it perfect. I love it. What Dan again. Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you for your service. And you know for what you're continuing to do to push that Coast Guard story. Well, God bless you fellows for putting the stories ahead. I want to be any part of that Coast Guard Museum. I have such unique things Coast Guard things. I've got stuff from the revenue cutter service. I've got things but I've also got aren't of sacks from those sunken shipwrecks on beringia out of the Arctic Ocean and things like that. So I would  Love to participate in any way I possibly could before this old carcass is dead. We're going to put you in touch with the right hand out the Newseum. We will put you in touch with the right people. Thank you Brothers. He listened Shipmates. This has been fun. Thanks so much. What a good. All right, boys. All right. Thank you Andrew. Thank you.

I was reminded of how conditioning works and how it can impact our relationship in our training with our horses. So we had a situation where a horse didn't want to leave the arena. It's would be very easy to consider this a Disobedience or disrespectful or the horse just not wanting to listen just being cheeky. Whatever words you want to use. It would have been really easy to say that the horse was testing us and that they just didn't want to leave the room.  because they didn't feel like it well when it really thought about it, so we paused and I you know, I explained to the client that the student that really what was happening is is that this horse had positive associations with the arena because that's where the horse has been predominantly living recently and there's other horses nearby is Foods their Waters there everything's there for him and every time he leaves the arena, he's leaving the close companionship of Hit the other horse friends and his food and  Is water and the comfort of the Arena. So the arena has been conditioned to be a safe positive place for him and leaving the arena every time he would leave the arena. He'd be taken away from all of those things that he found reassuring positive comfortable his companions, you know, everything that he wanted to be around so he had developed negative associations with being taken out of the arena and positive.  She actions with being in the arena, which is often the complete reverse of how most horses view the arena. It would have been really easy to consider this a training issue and at the end of the day it kind of is but we could have like I mentioned before resorted back to make him listen, he's being disobedient. He's being disrespectful and punishing him for his response when in reality the horses just doing what he's been conditioned to understand so if we hadn't spent  The time preparing him or showing him that leaving. The arena is also a positive experience than it would be natural for the horse to respond to leaving the arena in a negative way the when the horses only known leaving the arena means put into a stall or taken away from the companions. Then that means that they're only development with that. They're only connections with that action with that being taken out of the Arena are negative.  And there's this saying is called Pavlov's always on your shoulder. And what that means is that classical conditioning is always happening your horse is always developing positive or negative associations with everything happening with whenever something happens to them when there's a an object. I mean, there's simple objects such as jumps are jumps a negative or positive thing. There are other equipment you could consider like the clicker would be a positive thing. This is a  Example of how classical conditioning works we pair a food reward with the sound of the clicker and they understand that the click equals something positive that is a classical conditioning process. The horse is learning that the click means something good. Now the flip side of that lets say an easy example would be something like a whip. So often a whip is used to strike the horse or even just tap them. However, it's applied. It's usually in an adverse of way.  Way, so the whip develops an association in the horses mind and involuntary Association just by the way, it's being used as a negative tool and this is why often horses become afraid of the whip when you even just pick it up and hold it in your hand to change that idea in their mind that the whip is a bad thing. We have to use classical conditioning again, but in a counter conditioning way, so we have to reverse it. We have to counter condition their initial response that our initial of  Verse of response to the web and you and Associated now with good things so you could essentially, you know, touch the horse of the whip give food touch sources whip give food and they would learn that the touch of the whip equals a positive food reward. So something that they enjoyed so a positive Association would develop with being touched with the whip. So while yes, it is still a training situation. So the horse not wanting to leave the arena does come down.  To training it was a either a unintentional training of a negative association from leaving the arena or just a lack of training in general where the horse only understands that the arena is a positive place and everything else is not it is uncomfortable. It's stressful. It doesn't have companions whatever it is unintentional or intentional. It is a training process training is always happening is never not happening in our relationships and our interactions with our  Is but it is not necessarily about the thing that's happening. Right? Then it wasn't about divorce leading next to us. It wasn't about his response to the lead rope. It wasn't about him sticking with the owner and listening to the q's it wasn't about him walking out at the gate more wanting in to be disobedient or disrespectful. It had nothing to do with any of that. It was in a much deeper level where the horse just didn't.  I understand that it was okay to leave the arena because there are positive things that happen outside the arena as well and the way we go about fixing that like I mentioned was be a counter conditioning process and for counter conditioning to work. We have to start at the Comfort level of the horse. We have to start where they are comfortable where they are still in a positive mindset. Let's say so they are still doing just fine. They haven't gone over a line.  So an imaginary line where they're like, oh shoot. This is not good anymore. So we need to stay still in their comfort level and then we need to build we need to build up. So let's using the arena example again for him the negative association with leaving the arena had gone back as far as just having somebody approached him with the halter. He knew that having the halter put on meant he was being led out of the arena and that led to something unpleasant being outside of the  Arena so we had to go back and start where he was comfortable which is without a halter. So can I lead you around without a halter and Lead rope on and make that positive for you? Okay now can I put the halter on and it be a positive experience for you? All right now can we attach the lead rope and lead with a halter and Lead rope and develop that positive Association? Okay now can we get closer to the end gate of the arena and be comfortable and can I make that positive for you either with some sort of positive?  For some training, you know touching cones standing on your mat or just leading around and clicking and reinforcing. Can we make that a positive experience for you? And then once we have all of that firmly established in the horses now has a new positive association with being caught in the halter in the lead rope and being led around inside the arena. We can start taking the next steps towards leaving the arena which would be which would be to stand by the gate. Can we now open the gate? Can we now go?  Through the gate can we now lead outside the gate and it's so critical for that whole experience for the horse to be positive and by it being positive we need to think about it from the horse's perspective. Not just our perspective what I mean by that is often for people. The positive is a positive training session or a session that we feel is a good one is often centered around the idea that it was a success.  All training sessions that we accomplished what we set out to do that. We made our goals that we you know accomplished leaving the arena, but we don't often take into consideration the horses emotional and mental mindset State during those training environment. So just because we accomplished the goal that we set out for doesn't mean the horse actually enjoyed the process or found it to be a positive experience for the training session to be  positive for the horse. We have to be conscious of their emotional state so we can't just blow over the fact that they're fearful or worried or upset of any or in pain or anything like that. We need to be very conscious of their emotional state and mental state and stay in a comfort zone for them where they are doing that they're feeling comfortable not just comfortable as in we never push the comfort zone, but they are feeling  Infant, that would be the better word. So they're feeling confident the training there. They understand what's expected of them. They are not worried. They're not fearful when we can truly analyze what our horses are communicating to us and we can stay in there calm and confident and comfortable level we can stay below their fear thresholds. We can pay attention to their emotional state and mental state and stay focused on that and then just push it just gently just ask for a little bit more as they're ready for it then we  I make something a positive training environment for them and then to go even a step further would be to make the training situation actually involve positive reinforcement because what better way to classically conditioned to counter condition something to be positive if we're then using positive reinforcement if we're involving food scratches eating grass. I mean just hand grazing.  Is an excellent way to make leaving the arena. Let's say a positive experience. So let's say in this same example, which is exactly what we did today, which was okay. Your horse is not comfortable leaving the arena. Let's build up to it and when he's ready we'll go outside the arena and when we go outside the arena, we're going to go walk right over to this nice green patch of grass and we're going to hand Grace and your he's just going to get to graze on this grass that he doesn't normally get access to and then when we're done we're going to go back and that is  Going to be the total of his experience outside of the arena for today. And that would be the ultimate positive reinforcement. So positive conditioning counter conditioning experience to his previously negative association with leaving the arena. So not only did he not go back and not go into a stall and leave his friends and then have to work and all these negative things. He didn't have to do any that he got to do something.  Gimli positive which was to eat grass all horses love to eat grass. So it was a positive training session for both the human and the horse because we accomplished a goal of leaving the arena and we also made it a positive experience for the horse now as the training progresses and as we have more experience with positive, you know, making those positive associations with leaving the arena will start being able to add more to the training situation. So  The first day may just be eating grass outside the pasture for a little bit and it may take a while. Like let's say that it takes at least three four or five sessions of just going out and eating some grass and then going back in then the following session. We maybe we can add in some targeting or some practicing cones or you know doing something if you're not necessarily completely using positive reinforcement training with Target Training and all that you could ask for a basic.  Savior, like can you drop your head on Q? Can you yield your shoulder this one time and then go back to eating grass and then go back to the arena. So it could be this gradual reintegration. So reintroducing the idea of doing some training outside the arena, but it's not the end of the world. That's not the only thing that happens out here being outside of the arena is also a positive experience. But yes, sometimes I'm going to ask you to do X Y or Z and overtime.  As you work hard at building that positive Association will be able to like I said adding more into it and doing more training and doing more outside the arena and less Focus will if they have to be put on just making it a positive experience. Although I will say that my constant efforts are to always make any interaction I have with my horse a positive experience for them regardless of whether we're training. Just leading back to the stall. Just putting a halter on  Medicating their feet. I don't want those negative association. So those involuntary negative associations being developed with me or you know, I don't want the horse to associate me with negative outcomes that classical conditioning again is always happening and since it's always happening. My constant efforts are to reduce any associations any negative associations with me. Now, that's not to say that it's a hundred percent. Perfect all the time. There's always going to be situations where it's  Less than ideal. But if you spend a large portion of the time that you're with your horse, if you really are purposeful about making the interactions with your horse positive, then those that those positive associations those times that are positive will start to really outweigh those negative associations anything that could come up that's less than ideal will be absolutely drowned out by all the positive interactions we have with our horse and that's more what I am after. I'm after that. I'm  after my efforts to make this as a positive experience for the horse for my efforts to make those positive associations to really condition the horse to see me as a complete total positive outcome situation too heavily heavily outweigh anything that could go wrong or could be less than ideal and it helps in the long run because what starts to happen is when a horse  Is questioning whether something is going to be a positive or negative outcome when a horse is questioning whether they should leave the arena if they should go into that stall if they should get into the trailer if whenever that question mark shows up your relationship with that horse that classical conditioning process that time and effort. You've put into developing that positive relationship with your horse is going to start coming in to play it the horse is going to associate you with positive outcomes.  Comes and then will automatically start to trust that that positive outcome is going to be a result of that interaction with you. So trust equals a history of positive outcomes. And if you are the one that dictates positive outcomes, then you will be the one the horse trusts to predict positive outcomes in that will dramatically impact your relationship with your horse to be positive on the flip side if every time.  I'm we interact with their horse. If every time that we spend time with them if whenever we are doing something with a horse there is the potential for a negative outcome. If there's a lot of pressure there's a lot of punishment if we you know, maybe they find being ridden uncomfortable and every time you go out to visit your horse you ride and so maybe you're not even doing it intentionally, but if the saddle is uncomfortable and the horse has developed that negative association.  The saddle. So the horse has been conditioned to view the saddle as an aversive. And so they do not enjoy that saddle and they know it predicts pain and discomfort and then you're the one that predicts the arrival of the saddle. So every time you go out you get out the saddle which then predicts the pain it's this long chain of events that makes your relationship with the horse and negative association relationship. The relationship becomes compromised by this painful experience.  The horse has when it's interacting with you other things that might compromise the relationship would be lets say the situation where the horse doesn't want to leave the arena and we just automatic response. We think that the horse is being disrespectful or just trying to you know be difficult that day and we punish them or pressure them to leaving the arena when they're clearly uncomfortable with the situation when they're clearly communicating that they do not enjoy leaving the arena. They find leaving the arena stressful. It's a negative.  Situation for them and we push them past that limit if we punish them for wanting to stay in the arena and make it uncomfortable for them to be in there. And then we continue to do whatever we were doing outside of the Arena again. It's a no-win situation for the horse. They're punished for staying where they're comfortable and being outside. The arena is also uncomfortable and they're going to develop that association with you and your presence and you being around and it's going to impact your relationship and it can become  Is ongoing development in the relationship where your arrival were you being around the horse where you wanted to ride where you wanted to take the horse out of the Arena becomes a negative experience for the horse and your relationship. It is not in a healthy place. This also will impact the horses trust in you and in your relationship if usually interacting with you results in a negative outcome, they will not trust that future interactions with you are going to result in a positive.  A outcome, we have classically conditioned the horse to understand that our presence and our interaction with them results in a negative outcome that results in something uncomfortable something unpleasant something that they don't want to do something stressful all these different things when they are those associations develop with us. So whether it's a positive Association or a negative association is always developing its always being created. It's never not happening. So we  Be very careful to spend our time with our horses developing these positive associations so that they can learn to trust that the relationship with us that interaction with us will result in more positive outcomes and not negative outcomes so that when we do need the horse to step into a trailer when it's a little bit of a stressful situation, they can trust that a positive outcome is going to be the result of this situation versus just building one more negative.  situation on top of all the other ones they're much more likely to offer that behavior to be willing to go past their comfort zone to do something a little extra above and beyond something go past that stress Zone because they trust us to make it a positive outcome for them when we can think in terms like this when we can break down the process that goes into developing a relationship when we can break it all the way down to  Social conditioning to something as black-and-white as developing a positive or negative association with something. It takes away this unachievable goal of having this beautiful relationship with the horse that almost feels unachievable when we watch movies when we watch other people on social media just having these apparently beautiful bonds and relationships with our horses. And then we wonder how did they get there if the  Reality is what they're showing because you know social media and movies is not always reality. But if that's real if what they're showing is real it's likely the result of a history of positive outcomes and it is achievable and it is something we can do we can do it in our everyday actions step by step by step. Just leaving the stall taking the halter to the horse walking up to the stall in the morning any the little tiny actions everything that we do all day long when interacting with our horses are the  Building blocks of the relationship. They are step-by-step what gets us to that deep positive relationship with our horse where the horse can trust us where the horse is willing to do what we ask of them where they are comfortable around us and want to be around us. That's what relationships are built on that's what bond is built on that is how these mythical magical mystical relationships are developed. It's all about classical conditioning and showing your horse.  Teaching your horse conditioning your horse that being around you being with you will result in a positive outcome. And it's all based on classical conditioning. Thanks so much for listening.

       "\"hello. hello. hello everyone. this is katie and we are here together on our first ever episode of cream in your coffee. thank you so much guys for humoring me on this podcast journey. it is been a huge goal of mine for the past few years. i finally just growing a pair and jumping right into it and seeing how it goes. so, thank you again for bearing with me here.  alrighty guys, so i figured for the first episode why not jump into a topic that is so exciting for pretty much everybody out there just around the corner and seven or eight days. we have the wonderful christmas and i am so excited christmas is a great time of year for me. i just love the spirit of happiness and joy and the giving spirit. i love every single part of it and i hope that you guys are excited for it to obviously it would definitely  i say that most people are i find most excited about receiving gifts around christmas time. i am definitely the opposite i get really really awkward when someone gives me a gift but i get so excited to give someone else a gift and just to see their faces when they open it. i would like to think that i am pretty good with gifts. i usually think of something like thoughtful or i will even make something for someone so it really just depends on the person obviously, but i do not know doing something nice for someone always feels good, right?  anyways, so i wanted to just give a couple tips for you guys because i did work retail for several years of my life and i am honestly very very happy that i am not this year because i hate crowds and even though i work with people i kind of hate people. so seeing frantic men and women running all over the mall trying to figure out what to buy their loved ones for a holiday. that is like usually two days away is a little stressful for me, but this year i do not have to worry about  but thank goodness.  so my first tip for you guys is going to seem probably unhelpful right this minute, but in future christmases to come it is going to save you big time. it is going to save you stress and it is going to save you money come december so  i am going to say tip. number one santa knew what was up. okay, make a list and check that shit twice. i do not mean make a list right before you go out shopping the day of gentlemen. i am sure your shopping christmas eve. stop fucking doing that. i mean throughout the year make a list of things that your friends and family make comments about so things that they always use things that they want things they enjoy  and this is going to save you a headache because not only is this list going to have a backup list of things that you can buy if you are totally stuck on gifts, but you also have something to reference all year long.  when you can pick things up, so this is where it is going to save you financially. you are not coming around to december of next year and you are like shit. i do not have enough money to buy christmas gifts or you know, you see those memes that are like it looks like people going to be getting a merry christmas message for christmas. that is what my bank account looks like. no, you are going to go it is going to be july and your best friend janine really likes, you know, marc jacobs daisy perfume. so you pick it up in july and then you have it in your closet for janine come to  brr. okay, it is going to save you a gift that you have to remember to buy and it is going to save you money in december when you are already forking out the dough tip number one make a list kind of wraps into this number two or tip number two, because tip number two is by throughout the year things are going to go on sale people always get so excited for like black friday shopping and boxing day sales. i will say boxing day tends to have a little bit better.  sales, i personally find four things then black friday, but i have had this conversation with people before where they are like, oh my god, like black friday deals are so good. but people are lined up around the block. i guarantee you that best buy has pretty much that same deal on a television midway through the year. you just do not notice because you are not looking it up. so just be conscientious of what you are looking to buy and when the deals are honestly check throughout the year and you are going to save yourself at least like four.  out a chunk of dough in december at least you are saving yourself that financial burden if not finding the deals as well and saving money that way so tip number one is make a list and tip number two is by throughout the year.  the last tip that i will leave you guys with for the christmas season is the three gift rule. so this is something that i initially started doing for children and realize that it was also a really good starting point for gifts for your adult friends as well. so i the gifts are very simple one thing you want one thing you need and one thing to read. so one thing they want something they have brought up something that they have mentioned to you that they would love to have.  but they just cannot afford right now or whatever one thing they need. so ladies, you know, if your man's taking his pants off and his boxers look like moths have gotten into his underwear drawer. he needs some briefs and or underoos or boxers or whatever the hell you call them. go get you a man's some underwear. so again, the first two is one thing you want and one thing you need one thing you read. i love this one.  honestly, this is great. i love it because i used to read all the time and now it takes me five months to read a book that i would probably finish in two days. so one thing to read gets everyone on that educational truck and gives their brain a little bit of a workout.  now the one thing to read is also kind of a fun little gift because it gives the other person that you are giving to an insight into your brain and what you would kind of read or at least what you would suggest for them. so it opens up some avenues of may be an author that they never thought to look into or some storylines that they might like that they did not know they would so it is like a gift that keeps on giving you know, it is wonderful.  so those are my three christmas tips for you guys tip 1 make a list and check it twice tip to shop throughout the year rather than leaving it as one huge task and lump sum of money that you need to shell out come december and tip 3 is try the three gift rule.  so hopefully you guys found those tips at least minimally helpful. i found that anyone that i have told those things to obviously prior to december 17th have actually found that quite helpful to kind of do it throughout the year. like i said, it just takes a lot of burden off of you and the third tip at least helps you to have a platform to start with on how and where to start getting gifts.  so guys, like i said, i am a huge fan of christmas as much as i love the spirit of it though. like if you know me in person, you have seen me dressed up for work for christmas full on santa socks the whole getup that being said with all this excitement that i have for the christmas season. i do not actually decorate my place. um, i think i have one stocking that a friend gave me several years ago. and that is the one christmas decoration that i have and that goes  on my door, so i am not a huge decorator surprisingly enough. i will be having a guest on next week though for next episode and her family goes all out. so we will definitely be talking with her about her christmas traditions and how they decorate.  now you guys are probably thinking like what the fuck is this person talking about she loves christmas, but she does not decorate what is up with that. i do not know. i am just not a huge decorating person. it might also be because i have two small dogs and they just get into everything. i also live alone. so i think it just for me at least seems a little silly to set up a whole bunch of christmas decorations just to take them down for myself to look at them. i do not know if that is just a lot of effort with  a lot of return i guess. i do not know. i do not like snow either. so the weather recently has not exactly been my favorite, but given that it is christmas. i will take a nice fluffy layer of snow for christmas day that is acceptable, i guess so mother nature. feel free to send us a little bit of snow, but no ice no hail and no freezing rain. thank you.  so i am not a huge fan of snow and i do not decorate my place and i am not a huge fan of receiving gifts. i mean you guys are probably thinking why does this woman keeps saying that she loves christmas. so here is why i love christmas. as i said before. i love the joy that everyone has i love the good mood that it puts most people in although i hate snow. i do like when it looks like a winter wonderland - the slush and the slipping  so the joy i guess but absolutely my number one favorite thing about this season is seasonal coffees. so eggnog latte is starbucks. you know, what the fuck is up? that is my favorite. honestly, eggnog anything throw me some rum in that nog and we got a good time going on and also just the little the cops to  like just the festive little cups that they give you i love every part of it. yeah, if you did not catch that, i love eggnog. so in case anyone wants to gift me eggnog i can do something fun with that. maybe i do not i do not fucking know if anyone has any ideas of eggnog cocktails as well. i recently discovered an eggnog colada so fucking good. maybe we will talk about that on the next episode but  yeah, i mean definitely go check just starbucks and check out the eggnog latte is because if you seen my stories i pretty much have at least one a day for the entire month of december and then i wonder why i gained weight and it is actually because i have been drinking all the cream and egg. nog me now as for christmas traditions, i do not really do much. typically i hang out with my family on christmas day.  as most people do my family as you know, as you get older people typically end up moving all over the place. so this year we will not be having a big family christmas. i am lucky enough to have a fantastic boyfriend who is hosting christmas eve dinner this year. so i will be able to spend some time with him and hopefully i will be able to visit my brother and his fiance who are actually expecting so i am very excited to see them.  and say hello to their little nugget that is not born yet. but i think i got the right to rub her belly and say hello to the outer womb given. i am the baby's aunt i do not know roxy if you are listening to this, please let me know if i am not allowed to do that. so i do not make an awkward situation down the road. anyways guys. thank you so much for listening. like i said huge huge.  huge shout out to every single one of you that has listened because i am extremely nervous, but i am really happy that i put myself out there and gave it a try. so thank you so so much guys, and we will see you next episode where i will be interviewing one of my good friends katarina who like i said, her family is a huge christmas family, and we will be learning a little bit more about what they do for christmas on the next episode. thanks for tuning in guys. bye. \""
