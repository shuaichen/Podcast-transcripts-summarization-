# Podcast-transcripts-summarization-
TREC 2020 Spotify podcast transcripts summarization models

HI, thanks for opening this file.
This is Shuaichen’s Capstone project—Podcast transcripts summarization.
There are four python notebooks.

EDA on podcast metadata:
In this notebook, I text clean on descriptions and did some EDA on dataset.

Get the transcripts and pre_clean:
In this notebook, I get transcripts from json files and did text cleaning and EDA on transcripts. I concatenate descriptions and transcripts into one dataframe.

Extractive models:
In this notebook, I built extractive models, Baselines, TFIDF , Count Vectorization , Text rank model.

Abstractive model building:
In this notebook, I built seq2seq models based on LSTM layers. Also implement pretrained Bart-CNN model on dataset.


The processed dataframe which is 1.1GB, you can find it my google drive:
